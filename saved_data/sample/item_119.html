                </div><div><b>description:</b> Camel MINA in synchronous mode (InOut exchange pattern) does not handle exception thrown from MINA. Currently MINA intercepts this and logs the exception at WARN level.

We should override the proper method in Mina and handle it so the end user can deal with it.
Also it has been raisen on the forum that it does not propogate header and other properties. This should be raised in another ticket.

In the weekend I will work on a patch for Camel to fix this problem.
                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div>
                Should be fixed with the patch applied.

Please see CAMEL-375 instead

                The test of testReceiveNoResponseSinceOutBodyIsNull() and testReceiveNoResponseSinceOutBodyIsNullTwice() are failed in the linux box.

I just comment out this two test and reopen it.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> The 2nd patch:
- fixing all the unit tests so they should run
- UDP protocol now also supports synchronous mode
- added more unit tests to cover nearly 100%
- Mina configuration split into separate for acceptor and connector
- TCP protocol defaults to setReuseAddress(true) (UDP does this out-of-the-box from Mina)
                </div><div><b>label:</b> test
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Got it up and running except the UDP tests are failing. 

Using the right configuration objects also fixed a lot of warnings from Mina, so we are on the right track.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Okay MinaConsumer in camel was on a wrong foot with the configuration.

Apache Mina has distint configuration for acceptor and connector - in Camel this was the same configuration. We should split this into to config objects on the endpoint. Then we can have a acceptor config for the consumer that sets the reuse address configuration.

Also we could have a logger on the filer chain as the unit test does.

A patch is on the way before he end of the weekend.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Everything passes now. 

There are a few other corners of the camel-mina component I would like to improve and polish before submitting a patch.
And especially a few more unit tests is needed to cove the holes.

I added the synchronous mode for the UDP protocol as well.

                Okay got it sorted this morning at home. I will prepare at patch later this week.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Okay I am on track on something here. Inspired by the ReverseServer unit test in Camel.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html#setReuseAddress(boolean)

The reuse address is not set.
I will create a patch for this, and hopfully the tests will blaze on the Bamboo box.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Now it fails with another test for same problem. I guess camel or mina doesn't properly unbind the TCP listener. Maybe there should be some delays between the tests to allow some time for the unbind to settle in.

Anyone got a better clue. The tests runs with no problem on my XP box.

A workaround is to use a random port number each time but that is not what we really want is it?

                Applied the patch with thanks.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hmm the tests are failing because of the TCP port is already bound when the MinaConsumer is started.
