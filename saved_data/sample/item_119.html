Jenkins will by default insert dependency if missing in published pom.xml, which have hardcoded link path to jenkins server.
Instead we need to add a profile which is based on java.home path.

See the links from the nabble talk above.

Track down to be possible in parent/pom.xml with some antrun tasks that does some osgi versioning regex replacement.

And since this dependency is added to camel-core it gets inheirted by all the other artifcats. But only for SNAPSHOTs, and not releases. So I guess the release profile makes something different.

The tools JAR is thus not needed at all as a dependency to use Camel, so what we want is to get rid of tools JAR in the camel-core/pom.xml file.

                We should upgrade the bundle plugin as it does not need the special versioning stuff that the antrun plugin does, which drags in the tools JAR

I have a better fix for this....  

The tools jar is required for the schemagen stuff, not the  OSGi stuff.   In anycase, a better fix is coming.
