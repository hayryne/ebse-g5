This seems a bit strange and inconsistent. Instead (for non transactional tables), we should always use LATEST_TIMESTAMP if UPDATE_CACHE_FREQUENCY is non zero, with the exception of the corner case for UPSERT SELECT and DELETE where the same table is being read and written to (see changes to FromCompiler for PHOENIX-3823).

                [~tdsilva] - this would be a nice one to get in since the JIRAs associated with PHOENIX-3819 have been checked in. WDYT? Does this change make sense to you?

                [~jamestaylor]

You are referring to setting the MetaDataMutationResult mutation time to QueryConstants.UNSET_TIMESTAMP when update cache frequency is set and the cached entity hasn't expired right ? Later on when we create mutations if the timestamp is set to UNSET_TIMESTAMP we use the LATEST_TIMESTAMP.

{code}
 // Do not make rpc to getTable if
        // 1. table is a system table
        // 2. table was already resolved as of that timestamp
        if (table != null &amp;&amp; !alwaysHitServer
                &amp;&amp; (systemTable || resolvedTimestamp == tableResolvedTimestamp || connection.getMetaDataCache().getAge(tableRef) &lt; table.getUpdateCacheFrequency())) {
            return new MetaDataMutationResult(MutationCode.TABLE_ALREADY_EXISTS, QueryConstants.UNSET_TIMESTAMP, table);
        }
{code}

If the cached entry expired the MetaDataMutationResult mutation time is set to the server timestamp (same as the behavior of tables without  UPDATE_CACHE_FREQUENCY set). I think it makes sense to be consistent and always set the MetaDataMutationResult mutation time to QueryConstants.UNSET_TIMESTAMP if UPDATE_CACHE_FREQUENCY is set (except for the UPSERT SELECT/ DELETE corner case when the alwaysHitServer flag is set to true).

                Would you have some spare cycles to take this one, [~tdsilva]? If it's not too difficult, we can target it for 4.11.0.

                Sure I can pick this one up.

                Thanks for the patch, [~tdsilva]. One possible additional consideration is when a query uses CURRENT_DATE(). We typically piggyback on the timestamp we get back from the server as our current date so that we don't have to make another RPC. Can you make sure that we preserve this optimization? You might need to have a member variable in StatementContext that preserves the current date and then in addition, do what you're doing to have the result timestamp always be unset.

StatementContext.getCurrentTime() sets the current time based on the current table reference. If I modify MetadataClient.updateCache to set the mutation result time to UNSET_TIMESTAMP, then we lose the current date optimization that prevents the rpc. I don't see an easy way to get the statement context in updateCache.
Instead of modifying update cache, should I just modify MutationState.validate to set the server time stamp to UNSET_TIMESTAMP if UPDATE_CACHE_FREQUENCY is set ? This will then be used to generate the mutations. 

{code}
-            serverTimeStamp = timestamp;
+            // if UPDATE_CACHE_FREQUENCY is set the mutation result time is UNSET_TIMESTAMP *except* when the cached table expires
+            // so set the server time stamp to UNSET_TIMESTAMP to be consisent
+            serverTimeStamp = table.getUpdateCacheFrequency()!=0 ? QueryConstants.UNSET_TIMESTAMP : timestamp;
{code}
              </div></li><li><div>
                That seems reasonable, [~tdsilva]. Any holes with the upsert select or delete case where we need the time stamp set? Or if SCN is set? Would another option be to add a currentTime member variable to TableRef and capture the timestamp from the result there? I think you could the PTable there to check the updateCacheFrequency value.
