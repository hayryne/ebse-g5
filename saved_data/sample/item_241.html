 * Subclass of {@link org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem} that wraps with a {@link gobblin.util.limiter.Limiter}

 *

 *  {@link gobblin.util.limiter.Limiter} mapping.

 *
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  For methods that require HDFS calls, this class will first acquire a permit using {@link gobblin.util.limiter.Limiter},
 *  to make sure HDFS call rate is allowed by the uppper limit.

 * An implementation of {@link Limiter} that ony allows permits to be acquired from a pool.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   This implementation uses a {@link Semaphore} as a permit pool. {@link #acquirePermits(long)}
 *   is blocking and will always return {@link true} after the permits are successfully acquired
 *   (probably after being blocked for some amount of time). Permit refills are supported by this
 *   implementation using {@link Semaphore#release(int)}. Also {@link #acquirePermits(long)} only
 *   accepts input arguments that can be safely casted to an integer bounded by
 *   {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
 * &lt;/p&gt;

 * An implementation of {@link Limiter} that limits the time elapsed for some events.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   This implementation uses a task scheduled in a {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} that will
 *   fire once after a given amount of time has elapsed. The task once fired, will flip a boolean
 *   flag that tells if permits should be issued. The flag is initially set to {@code true}. Thus,
 *   no permits are issued once the flag is flipped after the given amount of time has elapsed.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   {@link #acquirePermits(long)} will return {@code false} once the time limit is reached. Permit
 *   refills are not supported in this implementation.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
