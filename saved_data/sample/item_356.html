                </div><div><b>description:</b> The starcgen code generator works OK, but could do with some improvements.
 * Uniquifying imports (handling multiple imports with same short suffix)
 * Generating multiple iterNatives (eg when the normal symbol is already taken).
 * Keying off of beam.Register* calls rather than command line.
 ** &nbsp;Avoids duplicating lists of identifiers, and improves default behavior.
 ** Possibly have a new beam.RegisterDoFn which can take a list of DoFn and struct types a function or a struct, and key off those, reducing boiler plate somewhat.
 * Perhaps having a specific single import alias package for components required for import, rather than the current 3-4.
 * Generate efficient Beam Schema coders for registered types?
 * Handle SplittableDoFns properly.

                I've successfully got a RegisterDoFn function working, and have partly got starcgen keying off of that method. Currently working on properly detecting and handling duplicate package short names.
