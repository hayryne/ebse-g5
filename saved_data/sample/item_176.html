                </div><div><b>description:</b> There's so many sub shells in karaf its kinda hard to get help on any single subshell without scrolling your terminal or using more; would be nice to be able to type

{code}
karaf@root&gt; help o&lt;TAB&gt;
karaf@root&gt; help osgi&lt;RETURN&gt;
{code}

and get help for all the osgi sub shell commands only (rather than pages and pages of help for all the commands available). 

i.e. argument complete on the sub shell names and only show the help for that sub shell once its complete.

Plus it'd be nice to tab complete this further to get an exact command - though this second option is less important, as folks can use tab completion on an exact command first, then add --help. Though for completeness it would be nice to be able to tab complete sub shells and commands via the help command too. 

It'd make the help more helpful :)
