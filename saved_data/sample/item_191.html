                I check maven plugin code and did some experiments. The conclusion is that Maven maps plugin configuration in xml to a Mojo(by @parameter annotation). And when the mojo has an array parameter(&lt;excludes&gt;&lt;/excludes&gt; in this case), maven do not check the sub-tag of that parameter.

                That's why the typo exclude works.
