h2. Things to review

Review process consists of the following steps:
 * Find the images that have not been donated, and create alternatives.
 * Fix any formatting issues from the automated process.
 * Review the "language" of the code examples, so syntax highlighing is correct.
 * Create learning trails.
 * Remove the "*Contents*" section of the tutorial pages (if any, the automatic process should have removed most of them), we should also remove the list of links to headings in the content in the Contents section. We're generating a Table of Contents automatically, so we don't need to manually create one.

h2. Asigning a tutorial to yourself

The review process will tackle different sets of Tutorials in the following order:
 # IDE Tutorials in src/content/kb/docs/ide
 # Java Tutorials in src/content/kb/docs/java
 # PHP Tutorials in src/content/kb/docs/php
 # Rest of tutorials: javaee, javame, web, webclient, websvc. Order will be defined later.

If you want to review some tutorials please create a subtask using the *"More"/"Create sub-task"* menu entry, like so

!image-2019-01-15-12-22-29-742.png|width=650,height=436!

When creating the sub-task remember to set the "*labels*" field to *documentation / third-donation / tutorials / website,* 
like so:

*!image-2019-01-15-12-26-14-652.png|width=741,height=126!*

Also remember to *clearly state the tutorials you're working with* (say "java/a*": all tutorials starting with "a" in the "java" folder, or "ide/git.asciidoc").
h2. Help Material / Tips &amp; Tricks

                The&nbsp;[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide|https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/] may be useful.

We may want to create (and publish) a NetBeans website styleguide for contributors.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I have taken this item from the list of bullets above:

* Create learning trails.

You can see them here, learning trails for the items focused on currently, i.e., java, php, and ide:

https://netbeans.apache.org/help/index.html

In those trails, the idea is to reflect as closely as possible the original content here, though focused on the texts right now, not the videos and so on (which are all outdated, i.e., the ones listed at https://netbeans.org/kb/index.html in various places are unusable because they're using old versions of NetBeans, Java, PHP, etc).
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Good. We may want to create copies of those trails later on under /kb/trails, when ready. So that the mapping from netbeans.org works correctly.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Agreed. Assigned all the tutorials under 'java' for myself (except that I'll leave the ones assigned to [~vieiro] to him).
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I suggest we remove this badge thing everywhere:

image::images/netbeans-stamp-80-74-73.png[title="Content on this page applies to the NetBeans IDE 7.2 and later"]

I.e., that badge, let's just remove it, and maybe, and only if needed, in the text at the top somewhere, indicate from which release the tutorial applies, and try to make it as non-release specific as possible, or in the parts that are release-specific, say so there.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Also, I suggest that we remove the "To complete this tutorial" table, if it only contains the need for NetBeans and for the JDK. I.e., these are standard assumptions to make -- except if a very specific version of NetBeans or the JDK is needed, or if some additional resource is needed. I.e., there's no need to have that standard table in all our tutorials.

                I have one big blocker: when an image is found within a numbered list, the numbered list is reset, i.e., see the below, in the first section there are 4 steps, each numbered as 1, because of the image: https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html

What is the fix for this? If this is fixed, I think we have everything we need for updating, reviewing, etc, all our tutorials. The rest is in perfect shape for making awesome tutorials live on GitHub for the first time ever.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> +1 to those.

Since the tutorials have a specific "templates/tutorial.gsp" template, I propose adding some links to the download page there.

Also many tutorials have a "Send Feedback" link that refers to a mail address. We can remove that and just leave the link to the github edit page, or we may want to set up a webpage indicating how to contribute to the tutorials.

Basically you add&nbsp; [start=3] before the numbered item.

                Great thanks, will try this.
              </div></li><li><div>
                OK, works, great. I'd like to change all the screenshots, can I simply delete the existing one on GitHub (where) and upload one with the same name? Or is there a different advised process.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yep, you can replace the screenshots. Try to keep them in the "images/" subdirectory close to the tutorial. Beware that an image can be used in different tutorials (but I don't think they're, though).
              </div></li><li><div>
                OK, I have replaced some of the images, but I think there's a problem updating/replicating to the live site, i.e., in GitHub you can see that the 1st and 4th screenshots in the below are new (in Mac) but they're not shown live on the site; can you check?

https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html
              </div></li><li><div>
                Also, what's the correct syntax for correctly displaying the images in this document, i.e., within a table:

https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/editor-codereference.html
              </div></li><li><div>
                The correct syntax (see [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=100827339)] is to replace the image:: with image: (i.e., a single colon).
              </div></li><li><div>
                First image in [https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html] is indeed an OS/X screenshot!

Try to hit SHIFT+Refresh in your browser, as content may be cached somewhere...
              </div></li><li><div>
                Got it, thanks.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Is there a way to add borders around images, i.e., see the images in the below, I'd like to have borders around them:

https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html

Or must an HTML img tag be used with the style attribute for that purpose?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> We can add borders around *all* tutorial images using CSS very easily. I can do that. Let me know any other features you need.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                That would be excellent, thanks a lot. Or make it optional, somehow?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I saw a commit about red and blue borders, but don't see that here even when I refresh, i.e., is there something I must do to get these borders?

https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html
              </div></li><li><div>
                Fantastic, looks great.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi,

&nbsp;Amazing work.

&nbsp;Some 2 cents remarks

&nbsp;On the editorial part (this will requiere css addition to netbeans.css),

&nbsp; I would suggest using :experimental: option for asciidoc that may interpret kbd:[Ctrl+Space] see ([https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/] section UI Macro ) and make nice looking keyboard key 

&nbsp; I would also suggest Admonition like NOTE: that create block for note.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Looking on the basic of layout,

&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that we loose a lot of place with the banner.

&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not clear what is emphased compare to the 8.2 website (IMHO font style too identical).

&nbsp;&nbsp; The outline menu only at the top of page, it would be a dream to have a menu that stay on a side and&nbsp; highlights where you are within the tutorial.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Agree, also, in addition to NOTE, would be good to have TIP. Both of them with an icon (like a lightbulb for tip, for example).
              </div></li><li><div>
                {quote}   It's not clear what is emphased compare to the 8.2 website (IMHO font style too identical).{quote}

Well, the 8.2 website will disappear, i.e., netbeans.org will redirect to netbeans.apache.org, after we complete the tutorial transition that we're working on now.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sorry it's only a rendering point.

I mean when there is a `text` between quote like :&nbsp; In the Project Name field, type `HelloWorldApp`

The text HelloWorldApp look very similar to the first part of the sentence.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ah, good point.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I done some experitment here

[https://github.com/ebarboni/incubator-netbeans-website/commit/4ad543952d6a96d4c21308f847819efd2d121f72]

&nbsp;The menu and button could work but for the Admonition it seem that the generated html is not containing enough items
{code:xml}
&nbsp;&lt;div class="admonitionblock note"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="icon"&gt;
&lt;div class="title"&gt;Note&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="content"&gt;
The aim of this tutorial is to get you started with NetBeans IDE. To get started understanding and working with the Java language itself, see the &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html"&gt;Java Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
{code}
it should looks like
{code:xml}
 &lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class="icon"&gt;
&lt;i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="content"&gt;
The aim of this tutorial is to get you started with NetBeans IDE. To get started understanding and working with the Java language itself, see the &lt;a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html"&gt;Java Tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

I'm not very aware of the possibility of jbake and asciidoc. Maybe [~vieiro] you have and idea.

Regards
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi all,

Thanks for all this feedback!
 * Of course we do want to improve the rendering/legibility of the tutorials. The standard NOTE:, TIP: and the experimental kbd:[], and menu:[] are asciidoc constructs that we want to improve using CSS. Keep sending suggestions and I'll try my best.
 * Regarding the table of contents scrolling with the page and highlighing the current section that would be a nice thing to do, but with a low priority, IMHO. I think it's more important to add a right aside that links to other tutorials, or that adds more stuff (news, twitter entries, etc.) than just the plain table of contents.
 * Agreed that the banner height should be smaller. We may even have a very small banner or no banner at all in the tutorials (would be easy to modify src/content/templates/tutorial.gsp to achieve that). Also we can replace the banner with links to different tutorial sections.
 * Finally regarding generating custom HTML with jbake, I'd suggest avoiding that as much as possible at the moment. That's a slippery slope we may want to take later on, to avoid making things more complicated. Adding icons to NOTE: and TIP:, for instance, can be done with some CSS hacks, I think, without resorting to custom Java programming.

                Admonitions have now proper icons.

See the "Admonitions" section at [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=100827339] for more details.

Remember that admonitions are all uppercase, this is, we write "NOTE: Whatever" and not "Note: Whatever".

For an example see [http://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html]
              </div></li><li><div>
                Great, thanks. Now what's wrong with this one, i.e., the NOTE is in capitals but the icon and rendering is not applied:

https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/java/javase-intro.html
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Instead of saying

{{**NOTE:**}}

which means "write a NOTE: but with bold emphasis", we should be saying:

{{NOTE:}}

which means "write a NOTE:" and add icons and other stuff as the CSS settings say.

This is, we should remove the asterisks, that are confusing Asciidoc, that doesn't know whether that's a note or a bold or what :)

See [https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/pull/189 |https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/pull/189]that updates this on all tutorials.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Great, done. But in this one, the first NOTE (in the section 'Cloning a Repository from GitHub via SSH protocol') is indented and the 2nd one isn't, what can be done to fix the first one to not be indented, i.e., what's wrong with the rendering here, I've seen that in other places too:

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Great, looking good.

I was thinking about the outlines on the right -- the title of the tutorial is included there, which I don't think is needed. Maybe only === headers (i.e., these are section headers) and not == headers (i.e., what I am using for the title of the tutorial) should be included.

Unless I am using these incorrectly.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                By the way, I merged this one, as an experiment, which is why the banner is now blue in the background. 

https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/pull/96

Not sure I like it, not sure I don't. Feel free to change back etc.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Actually, I like it. (And that swirl thing on the right is still a reference to the old NetBeans splash screen etc.)

Main thing I am curious about now is how the tutorials would look with no/less high banner.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I like it too!

Will take a look at the TOC later on.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Reduced the height of the news section on all pages.

Regarding the TOC, maybe we're doing it wrong !?

See [http://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/ide/mysql.html] for an example of structure.

Maybe we want to add the title of the tutorial automatically (so we don't need to use a "== " for that) and then structure the sections using ("== ") as in mysql.html ?
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Makes sense, will fix. But how should we do the title? There's no title in mysql.html.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The new banner height is great!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Regarding the title, we can try to extract the level 0 header ("= XXX") and add it there. It seems asciidoctorj does not add it to the document :(. Let me investigate to see if we can add it there as well for tutorials.

Can you implement this? Would be great, and would be the only blocker for completing the tutorial tweaks and restructurings.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Yep. I think it's doable. It would also be good for generating an ePub (if we want) with the tutorials.

I'll try to do it on the "tutorials" only (all tutorials are tagged with the ":jbake-type: tutorial", so that the rest of the website isn't affected.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Ah, we have two "Level 0" titles at [https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/blob/master/netbeans.apache.org/src/content/kb/docs/java/quickstart.asciidoc] ...

{{= NetBeans IDE Java Quick Start Tutorial}}
{{ :jbake-type: tutorial}}
{{(etc)}}
{{:keywords: Apache NetBeans, Tutorials, NetBeans IDE Java Quick Start Tutorial}}

{{= Java Quick Start Tutorial}}

{{Welcome to Apache NetBeans IDE!}}

That's not what we want.

We want that the very fist (and unique) level 0 title ("= NetBeans IDE Java Quick Start Tutorial") to be included in the page, and the second one ("= Java Quick Start Tutorial") can then be removed. Asciidoctor documents can only have a level 0 ("= ...") header.

So it seems either jBake or Asciidoctorj are ignoring that "NetBeans IDE Java Quick Start Tutorial" header. Will investigate how to make it available, otherwise we'll have to read the asciidoc ourselves, and that's something we don't want.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                Great, feel free to tweak quickstart.asciidoc as you experiment with this.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> See [https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/pull/217]

Now:
 * There's no need to repeat the title of the document in the content: the "= XXX" title at the top is used as the title and included in the document automatically.
 * All sections after that start with "== XXX", etc. normally

This applies to tutorials only, later on this should be the default behaviour in all pages (that can be done in a future PR).

We'll have to review those tutorials repeating the title in the content, as there's no need to repeat it now.

                Excellent, many thanks, it works!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I think it would be really helpful to have two states for a tutorial: "ready to be used" and "under review", with an icon for each, that we could put on each tutorial as an indicator and to set expectations. Could you create such an enhancement, assuming you agree with it? 

It would not be release-specific, i.e., it would not be "tested for Apache NetBeans 10" or something, it would be a general comment of go/no go per tutorial.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Easy. We can use the metadata of the document to tag which tutorials are reviewed.

We can create a, say, "reviewed" tag, and set it to true, like so:

{{= Using Own Custom Annotation Processors in the IDE}}
{{*:reviewed: true*}}
{{ :jbake-type: tutorial}}
{{ :jbake-tags: tutorials }}
{{ :jbake-status: published}}
{{ :syntax: true}}
{{ :source-highlighter: pygments}}
{{ :toc: left}}
{{ :toc-title:}}

Then we can check for the value of this tag in tutorials.gsp (that would be ${content.reviewed}) and add some custom text explaining what the status of the tutorial is.

Which texts would you like to include?

                Hi [~vieiro] I would propose instead of a boolean to put the version string of version it was reviewed.

Would be like

*:reviewed: 10.0,9.0*&nbsp;

and to test for emptyness so we may later add filter or so on version of NetBeans

&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                That would be great, I agree, we need something like this soon so we can indicate which ones can be relied on and which ones not yet.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Would be appreciate, or some simple way to indicate which have been reviewed and which not.

                Hi [~GeertjanWielenga]

Please see&nbsp; [https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/pull/276]
 * Reviewed tutorials must include a :reviewed: 9+ (or :reviewed: 9, 10) tag in the metadata.
 * Otherwise a note appears indicating that the tutorial needs reviewing. With a link to...
 * ... to a /kb/docs/contributing.html page that indicates the guidelines we're using in the tutorials (you can see this page in the PR here [https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website/blob/05b2326cb1c68e718bc6506677268483dac1a1c7/netbeans.apache.org/src/content/kb/docs/contributing.asciidoc] ).

Feel free to review the PR and merge it when you consider appropriate.
