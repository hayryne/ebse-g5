I dont think it's necessarily an optimization - might actually be _easier_ to implement this way :)

bq. If the other NN is still in standby then it should fail to start as it does currently
Can you explain what you mean by this? Why not allow it to download the image from the other NN anyway?
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Wrt #1, if we get the image from the NN and the edits from the shared dir, are we sure they'll always match, eg what if we're rolling at the same time (the other NN could be primary and active)? I was thinking asking for both from the primary would mean we always get matched sets and therefore don't need to worry about races.

Wrt #2, yea, I thinking we should be explicit (don't have to worry about eg the shared dir being populated by neither NN having populated name dirs, which we know won't be the case if the other is active), but on 2nd thought I think your suggestion is better.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The primary shouldn't be removing any old images unless it's taking checkpoints. But there won't be checkpoints if the standby isn't running yet (assuming the standby is the one doing checkpointing). So if we get the most recent image from the NN, then we should always have enough edits in the shared dir to roll forward from there.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Don't we support using both the SBN and 2NN though?  There are issues requiring the SBN be the checkpointer, eg no one is doing checkpointing if the primary dies and you fail-over or the SBN still checkpoints but doesn't have enough memory.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> We don't currently support using the 2NN with HA -- we'd need to improve it to upload the checkpointed images to both NNs. If we think this is critical we should file another JIRA for it... in HDFS-2291 I actually have added a check to the 2NN startup that makes it fail to start if HA is enabled.

                &gt;if the SBN has empty name dirs it should downloads the image and log from the primary (as an optimization it could copy the logs from the shared dir).
I am missing this:  both Image and Edits should be on shared dirs (ie no need to copy image from primary - it should be available in shared dir).


              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Can we generalize this: on startup, a NN (PNN or SBN) should make all dirs consistent - i.e. copy any missing images and logs.

                bq. I am missing this: both Image and Edits should be on shared dirs (ie no need to copy image from primary - it should be available in shared dir).

Since we generalized the edit log interface, we can't store images on the shared edit storage. We only get the stream abstraction for it. We could also extend the system to require a shared *image* dir, but then we couldn't support BK-based HA. (In the future when we can store checkpoints in HDFS itself we wouldn't have that issue)
              </div></li><li><div>
                I dislike the idea of pulling the image from the primary through a protocol. (But I guess it is needed for the BNN solution.)  For shared storage one could require that a shared dir be configured (NFS now and HDFS in the future by the time we get Bookeeper.).

                Attached patch adds a new command {{hadoop namenode -bootstrapStandby}}. This command connects to the running active, fetches nameservice info, displays it for the user, and allows the user to reformat the standby's local directories based on the remote NN's info. Then, it uses the existing checkpoint transfer code to copy the most recent image from the standby into the local directories.
It also ensures that the remote node's shared edits dir is visible on the local machine before performing the reformat.
