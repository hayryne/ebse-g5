                The attached patch is part of the YARN-1051 effort, as for the other patches in this series does not work on itself but it has been cut for ease of reviewing.

Given previous discussions, we introduced subclasses for ParentQueue and LeafQueue that are dynamically addable/removable/resizeable, 
as well as changes in the CapacityScheduler to support the "move" of applications across queues. These are core features, we tested on a cluster
running lots of gridmix and manual jobs, and seems to work fine, but I am sure there are corner cases and possibly metrics that are not updated 
correctly under all cases.  We should also create a new set of tests for the dynamic behavior of the CapacityScheduler.

                Thanks for uploading the patch [~curino], [~subru]. They're great additions to current CapacityScheduler. I took a look at your patch,

*First I have a couple of questions about its background, especially {{PlanQueue}}/{{ReservationQueue}} in this patch. I think understanding background is important for me to get a whole picture of this patch. What I can understand is,*
# {{PlanQueue}} can have a normal {{ParentQueue}} as its parent, but all children of {{PlanQueue}} can only be {{ReservationQueue}}. Is it possible that multiple {{PlanQueue}} exist in the cluster?
# {{PlanQueue}} is initially setup in configuration, as same as {{ParentQueue}}, it has absolute capacity, etc. But different from {{ParentQueue}}, it has user-limit/user-limit-factor, etc.
# {{ReservationQueue}} is dynamically initialized by PlanFollower, when a new reservationId acquired, it will create a new {{ReservationQueue}} accordingly
# {{PlanFollower}} can dynamically adjust queue size of {{ReservationQueue}}s to make resource reservation can be satisfied.
# Is it possible that sum of reserved resource exceeds limit of {{PlanQueue}}/{{ReservationQeueu}} and preemption triggered?
# How to deal with RM restart? It is possible that RM restart during resource reservation, we may need to consider how to persistent such queues

Hope you could share your ideas about them.

*For requirement of this ticket (copied from JIRA),*
# create queues dynamically
# destroy queues dynamically
# dynamically change queue parameters (e.g., capacity)
# modify refreshqueue validation to enforce sum(child.getCapacity())&lt;= 100% instead of ==100%
# move app across queues

I found #1-#3 are dedicated used by {{PlanQueue}}, {{Reservation}}. IMHO, it should be better to added them to CapacityScheduler and don't couple them with ReservationSystem, but I cannot think about other solid senarios can leverage them. I hope to get feedbacks from community before we couple them with ReservationSystem. And as mentioned by [~acmurthy], can we merge add queue to existing add new queue mechanism?
#4 should be only valid in {{PlanQueue}}. Because if we change this behavior in {{ParentQueue}}, it is possible that some careless admin will mis-setting capacities of queues under a parent queue, if sum of their capacity don't equals to 1, some resource may not be able to be used by applications. 

*Some other comments (Majorly about move app because we may need consider scope of create/destory queues first):*
1) I think we need consider how moving apps across queues work with YARN-1368. We can change queue of containers from queueA to queueB, but with YARN-1368, during RM restart, container will report it is in queueA (we don't sync them to NM when do moveApp operation). I hope [~jianhe] could share some thoughts about this as well.
2) Move application in CapacityScheduler need call finishApplication in resource queue and submitApplication in target queue to make QueueMetrics correct. And submitApplication will check ACL of target queue as well.
3) Should we respect MaxApplicationsPerUser in target queue when trying to move app? IMHO, we can stop moving app if MaxApplicationsPerUser reached in target queue.

Thanks,
Wangda

                [~wangda] Thanks for the very detailed comments. I agree that understanding the context is essential &amp; glad to help with that. Overall your understanding is spot on, please find answers to your questions below: 

1) Yes, it is possible to have multiple PlanQueues (e.g., if two organization want to dynamically allocate their resources, but not share among them). This is also good to "try" reservation on a small scale and slowly ramp up at each org's pace.
2) The extra confs are needed to automate the initialization of key parameters of the dynamic ReservationQueues (without requiring full specification of each of those).
3) Correct
4) Correct
5) First: the Plan guarantees that the sum of reservations never exceed available resources (replanning if needed to maintain this invariant to handle failures). On the other hand, like it happens for normal scheduler we can leverage "overcapacity" to guarantee high cluster utilization. More precisely, depending on the configuration (or dynamically on whether reservations have gang semantics or not) we can allow resources allocated to PlanQueue and ReservationQueue to exceed their guaranteed capacity (i.e., set the dynamic max-capacity above the guaranteed one). In this case preemption might kick in if other apps with more rights on resources have pending askss. Part of the changes in YARN-1957 were driven by this.
6) To limit the scope of changed, we agreed to have a follow up JIRA to address HA. The intuition we have is that it is sufficient to persist the Plan alone. During recovery, the _Plan Follower_ will resync the Plan with the scheduler by creating the dynamic queues for currently active reservations. We will be happy to have your input when we work on the HA JIRA.

[~curino] will answer your questions specify to this JIRA.

                Hi [~subru], 
Thanks for your elaboration, it is very helpful for me to understand the background.

Regards,
Wangda

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks again for the fast and insightful feedback. 

*Regarding how the patch matches the JIRA:*
Our initial implementation was indeed making the changes (i.e., the dynamic behaviors) in ParentQueue and LeafQueue themselves. Previous feedback pushed us to have subclasses to in a sense isolate the changes to dynamic subclasses. I think we can go back to the version modifying directly ParentQueue and LeafQueue if there is consensus. #4 is required because we cannot transactionally “add Q1, resize Q2” so that the invariant “size of children is == 100%” is maintained. As a consequence we must relax the constraints (either in ParentQueue if we remove the hierarchy, or as it is today in PlanQueue).  The good news is that the percentages from the configuration are not interpreted as actual percentages, but rather used as relative "weights" (ranking queues in used_resources / guaranteed_resources). This means that even a careless admin will not get resources unused.  For example, if we set two queues to 10,40 (i.e., something that doesn't add up to 100), the behavior is equivalent to setting them to 20,80 (as they are used only for relative ranking of siblings). I think this is also ok for hierarchies (worth double checking this part).

So all in all we can pull up to {{ParentQueue}} and {{LeafQueue}} all the dynamic behavior if there is consensus that this is the right path.

*Regarding move:*
1) Good catch... We will wait for feedback from Jian on this.
2) I think we had that at some point and did not work correctly. We will try again.
3) There are few invariants we do not check. {{MaxApplicationsPerUser}} is one of them, but also how many applications can be active in the target queue, etc... As I was mentioning in my previous comment, this is likely fine for the limited usage we will make of this from {{ReservationSystem}}, but it is worth expand the checks we make (see {{FairScheduler.verifyMoveDoesNotViolateConstraints(..)}}) to expose move to users via CLI.

                Hi [~curino],
Thanks for your reply,
For regarding how the patch matches the JIRA:
Since I don't have other solid use cases in my mind that others besides {{ReservationSystem}} can leverage these features, I don't have strong opinions to merge such dynamic behaviors into {{ParentQueue}}, {{LeafQueue}}. Let's wait for more feedbacks.
I agree that we can consider queue capacity as a "weight", it will be easier for users to configure, and it's a backward-compatible change also (except it will not throw exception when sum of children of a {{ParentQueue}} doesn't equals to 100).

bq. As I was mentioning in my previous comment, this is likely fine for the limited usage we will make of this from ReservationSystem
I think for moving application across queue is not a ReservationSystem specific change. I would suggest to check it will not violate restrictions in target queue before moving it.

Thanks,
Wangda
              </div></li><li><div>
                Agreed on all of the above.

This makes sense, we should compile a list of invariant to check for (I have a few in mind, but feedback is likely useful).

Thanks,

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi [~curino],
Thanks for updating, I just took a look, some minor comments,

1) CapacityScheduler#removeQueue
{code}
    if (disposableLeafQueue.getCapacity() &gt; 0) {
      throw new SchedulerConfigEditException("The queue " + queueName
          + " has non-zero capacity: " + disposableLeafQueue.getCapacity());
    }
{code}
removeQueue check disposableLeafQueue's capacity &gt; 0, but addQueue doesn't check. In addition, 
After previous check, ParentQueue#removeChildQueue/addChildQueue doesn't need check its capacity again.
And they should throw same type of exception (both SchedulerConfigEditException or both IllegalArgumentException)

2) CS#addQueue
{code}
      throw new SchedulerConfigEditException("Queue " + queue.getQueueName()
          + " is not a dynamic Queue");
{code}
Should "dynamic Queue" should be "reservation queue" comparing to similar exception throw in removeQueue?

3) CS#setEntitlement
{code}
      if (sesConf.getCapacity() &gt; queue.getCapacity()) {
        newQueue.addCapacity((sesConf.getCapacity() - queue.getCapacity()));
      } else {
        newQueue
            .subtractCapacity((queue.getCapacity() - sesConf.getCapacity()));
      }
{code}
Maybe it's better to merge the add/substractCapacity to changeCapacity(delta)
Or just create a "setCapacity" in ReservationQueue?

4) CS#getReservableQueues
Is it better to rename it to getPlanQueues?

5) ReservationQueue#getQueueName
{code}
  @Override
  public String getQueueName() {
    return this.getParent().getQueueName();
  }
{code}
I'm not sure why doing this, could you please elaborate? This makes this.queueName and this.getQueueName has different semantic.

6) ReservationQueue#substractCapacity
{code}
this.setCapacity(this.getCapacity() - capacity);
{code}
With EPSILON, it is possible this.capacity &lt; 0 set substract, its better to cap this.capacity in range of [0,1]. Also addCapacity

7) DynamicQueueConf
I think unfold it to two float as parameter for setEntitlement maybe more straigtforward, is it possible more fields will be add to DynamicQueueConf?

8) ParentQueue#setChildQueues
Since only PlanQueue need sum of capacity &lt;= 1, I would suggest make this method protected, and PlanQueue can overwrite this method. Or add a check in ParentQueue#setChildQueues.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Wangda,

Thanks for the great feedback. You spot a bunch of oddities that were there due to previous versions of the reservation system, 
but not needed anymore, I think the updated version is definitely cleaner. 

We address 1,2 by:
 * moving addQueue and removeQueue to PlanQueue (as they were only invoked on instances of the subclass).
 * making uniform checks from within the PlanQueue for capacity &gt; 0, and throw uniform SchedulerConfigEditException
 * fixing the log, and making the logs more uniform

We address 3,6 by:
 * merge addCapacity and subtractCapacity into a single changeCapacity
 * make checks of range limits 0,1 
(this reduced code both in CS and ReservationQueue... good call!)

We address 4 by:
 * getReservableQueues() has been renamed to getPlanQueues()

Regarding 5: ReservationQueue#getQueueName 
 * This is the result of our previous conversations with Vinod, Bikas, and Arun. The idea is that the user should not be 
aware of the fact that we use queues to implement reservations, and thus it shouldn't see the name of the reservation 
queue to be listed in the UI, but rather the name of the parent PlanQueue. More precisely, we have options for the UI 
to show or not the subqueues, but this differentiation is needed here to allow that: getQueueName for a ReservationQueue
return the parent, while getReservationQueueName() returns the actual local name.

Regarding 7: DynamicQueueConf
* We currently are only dynamically assigning capacity, but you can imagine in the future that this is extended to set many
more parameters for a queue (user-limit factors, max applications, etc..). The conf-based mechanism is future-proofing against this.

Regarding 8:  ParentQueue#setChildQueues
* I don't understand the comment. This check is automatically bypassed for PlanQueue (that by design have no children see 
CapacityScheduler near line 562).

We are testing the new version of the patch now, and will post patch soon.

                Hi [~curino],
Thanks for updating, I think current approach looks good to me, except Regarding 5,
I just have a chat with Subru, as you mentioned, changing this is majorly making ReservationQueues not existed in user side. But I still concern about changing the semantic, since it's still a very important semantic of CSQueue. I hope to get more feedbacks about this before moving forward, I'll think about this myself as well.

Thanks,
Wangda
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I share the uncertainty towards getQueueName returning the name of the parent. It seems the least intrusive way to mask the user from our internal queue management. The alternative is to use a QueueName class instead of String, and allow the receiver to use a "displayName" or "localName"... but this has awfully broad footprint. Alternatively we can add a "getDisplayName" to CSQueue to be used by the UI, and implement it everywhere as getQueueName except in ReservationQueue where we can answer with parent name. Again a bit large of a change for a rather minor outcome.  

Thanks,
Carlo

              </div></li><li><div>
                The patch seems missing some file changes and cause compilation failure.  (e.g. getReservationID)
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~jianhe] that is expected. As I was saying in one of the [early comments | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1707?focusedCommentId=14075076&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14075076] we are cutting YARN-1051 into several smaller patches for ease of reviewing, but we are trying to make each patch work as standalone (too many dependencies, and a bit of a waste of time, 
as they will not be valuable independently). So the fact that doesn't compile is expected. We mark them as patch available to signal they are ready to be reviewed.   

[~wangda]: we have implemented the getDisplayName alternative I mentioned above, and we are in the process of testing it. We will post an updated patch soon (again not a stand-alone one necessarily).

Thanks again to both of you for quick rounds of review and insightful comments.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi Carlo, thanks for your work !  I looked at the patch, some comments and questions:
- to simplify, we can use getNumApplications() method
{code}
disposableLeafQueue.getApplications().size() &gt; 0
        || disposableLeafQueue.pendingApplications.size() &gt; 0
{code}
- PlanQueue.java 80 column limit
- why “newQueue.changeCapacity(sesConf.getCapacity());” is inside the check and “queue.setMaxCapacity(sesConf.getMaxCapacity());” is outside the check
- CapacityScheduler#getReservationQueueNames seems getting the child reservation queues of the given plan queue. We can use the planQueue#childQueues directly
- DynamicQueueConf, how about calling it QueueEntitlement to be consistent ?
- CapacityScheduler#parseQueue method, I think we can simplify the condition for isReservableQueue flag something like this:
 {code}
    boolean isReservableQueue = conf.isReservableQueue(fullQueueName);
    if (isReservableQueue) {
      ParentQueue parentQueue = 
          new PlanQueue(csContext, queueName, parent,
              oldQueues.get(queueName));
      queue = hook.hook(parentQueue);
    } else if ((childQueueNames == null || childQueueNames.length == 0))
{code}
- just to simplify, this log msg may be put after previous “qiter.remove();” to avoid the removed boolean flag.
{code}
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
      LOG.debug("updateChildQueues (action: remove queue): " + removed + " "
          + getChildQueuesToPrint());
    }
{code}
- we can add a new reinitialize in ReservationQueue which does all these initializations. 
{code}
      CSQueueUtils.updateQueueStatistics(
          schedulerContext.getResourceCalculator(), ses, this,
          schedulerContext.getClusterResource(),
          schedulerContext.getMinimumResourceCapability());
      ses.reinitialize(ses, clusterResource);
      ((ReservationQueue) ses).setMaxApplications(this
          .getMaxApplicationsForReservations());
      ((ReservationQueue) ses).setMaxApplicationsPerUser(this
          .getMaxApplicationsPerUserForReservation());
{code}
- IIUC, right now, queueName here is for the planQueue(inherits parentQueue), and the reservationID is for the reservationQueue(inherits from leafQueue). I think if we can get the proper reservationQueueName(leafQueue) upfront and pass it as the queueName parameter into this method, we can avoid some if/else condition changes inside this method and the method signature. 
{code}
  private synchronized void addApplication(ApplicationId applicationId,
    String queueName, String user, boolean isAppRecovering,
    ReservationId reservationID)

                Subra, thanks for your update, looks good to me overall, we are almost there. just few minor things:
- Given we have the hideReservationQueues flag, I think if we still return reserveQueue name for the reservationQueue, it won’t be exposed. 
{code}
  @Override
  public String getDisplayName() {
    return this.getParent().getQueueName();
  }
{code}
-  the visibility may not need to be changed
{code}
-  private boolean unreserve(FiCaSchedulerApp application, Priority priority,
+  protected boolean unreserve(FiCaSchedulerApp application, Priority priority,
{code}
- why we added this null check.
{code}
if (application != null) {
        synchronized (application) {
          return assignReservedContainer(application, node, reservedContainer,
              clusterResource);
        }
      }
{code}
- I think we may pass the EntitileMent class into the changeCapacity method and update both capacity and maxCapacity 
{code}
      newQueue.changeCapacity(entitlement.getCapacity());
      // note: we currently set maxCapacity to capacity
      // this might be revised later
      queue.setMaxCapacity(entitlement.getMaxCapacity());
