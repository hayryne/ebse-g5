                Ping @boyuanzz; this PR just migrates changes from beam-site repository to beam. This change was automated with a migration script and required no manual changes.

                Starting to look at this now. The plan is to first move code into a separate branch. I can do this on my own fork for now, but eventually we'll want to push to apache/beam in order to develop Jenkins tests. 

Does anybody know the process for pushing a new branch? /cc [~robertwb] [~herohde]
              </div></li><li><div>
                Is there any advantage to having a separate branch? There are lots of downsides...
              </div></li><li><div>
                Prototype script based on [PR#5556|https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5556]: https://gist.github.com/swegner/233ede6e4764009a93bcaf0091bf02d2
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~robertwb] this topic came up while designing the migration plan: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1lfbMhdIyDzIaBTgc9OUByhSwR94kfOzS_ozwKWTVl5U/edit?disco=AAAAB50kLW0

The primary goal is to have a place to iterate on migration while making it clear that we aren't yet accepting PR's there. Perhaps it would be sufficient to make the changes on master and just monitor for any PRs that come in.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, we could just ask people to make changes elsewhere if we get PRs there. Also, the script above can be used multiple times, i.e. even if changes are done in both places it's just a git merge to get master that has everything.&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Makes sense to me. I'll update the doc the reflect the new plan.
