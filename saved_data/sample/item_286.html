                </div><div><b>message:</b> Log Collation - Memory leak when all hosts are down.

This patch is intended to address issue #2416. When all hosts are down, the log output is supposed to be
written to an orphan file. The LogHost::orphan_write_and_try_delete() is supposed to consume a LogBuffer
reference count, but it only does so in one branch of the if/then/else instead of both. This patch
fixes this issue.

(cherry picked from commit 3bf26d17e6bb8aed07de5681a9bdc75e59b72294)

                </div><div><b>body:</b> 
 This memory leak is the result of configuring a log collation host in “logs_xml.config” and then having the host be down during the traffic run. We verified that this occurs with vanilla 6.2.1. We also noticed that there was a memory leak fix in this function patched in TS-4872, which is present in 6.2.x, 7.1.x, and master. So we tried the latest 6.2.x (current) from yesterday, but the memory leak still occurred. We have also seen that bringing up the log host during the test run stabilizes the memory allocation so we’re pretty sure that this is the trigger for the memory leak.
