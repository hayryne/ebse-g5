                Thanks, `{{camel.component.twitter-directmessage.user}}` works. 

`@ConfigProperty` and `@Inject` do not work because we do not let Arc to instantiate them https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/c74d4a2846c5bd5b6c2963e9b2d8ccf78fadd4a9/extensions/core/deployment/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/core/deployment/CamelInitProcessor.java#L88 The question is whether we should fix this?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> thereâ€™s a bean post processor in camel that usually take cares of doing
injection so we perhaps need to implement a dedicated one for arc
