{noformat}
  ant test -Dtestcase=TestSearcherManager -Dtestmethod=testSearcherManager -Dtests.seed=459ac99a4256789c:-29b8a7f52497c3b4:145ae632ae9e1ecf
{noformat}

It was tripping the assert inside SearcherLifetimeManager.record,
because two different IndexSearcher instances had different IR
instances sharing the same version.  This was happening because
IW.getReader always returns a new reader even when there are no
changes.  I think we should fix that...

Separately I found a deadlock in
TestSearcherManager.testIntermediateClose, if the test gets
SerialMergeScheduler and needs to merge during the second commit.

                mike, I just had a quick look but is this intentionally?
{code}
-      return IndexReader.openIfChanged(oldReader, writer, applyDeletes);
+      return IndexReader.openIfChanged(oldReader, applyDeletes);
{code}

seems like you are not opening a NRT reader there anymore?

                Thanks Simon.

It should still be opening an NRT reader: if you have an NRT reader (which we do here) and pass that to IR.openIfChanged, you'll always get back a new NRT reader (this is the contract of IR.openIfChanged).

So I believe passing writer here wasn't necessary?

                Steve just took a stack trace (and aborted the build) of a test run started yesterday.
I noticed "SearchManager" in one of the traces.  Maybe this issue fixes?

hmm, however the signature of openIfChanged(IR, boolean) actually referes to openIfChanged(IndexReader oldReader, boolean readonly) which seems confusing when you pass applyDeletes to it, no?

Indeed I think this fixes it; I just committed that test-only fix.

Ugh, you're right!

In fact we don't need to pass applyDeletes either; this too is inherited from the prior reader.  So I'll just reduce it to IR.openIfChanged(oldReader).  Hmm then we can simplify SearcherManager some.  I'll work out a new patch.

yeah nice! looks good mike!
