                </div><div><b>description:</b> Jetty 9.3 offers support for HTTP/2. Interest in HTTP/2 or its predecessor SPDY was shown in [SOLR-6699|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-6699] and [on the mailing list|http://markmail.org/message/jyhcmwexn65gbdsx].

Among the HTTP/2 benefits over HTTP/1.1 relevant to Solr are:

* multiplexing requests over a single TCP connection ("streams")
* canceling a single request without closing the TCP connection
* removing [head-of-line blocking|https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed]
* header compression

Caveats:
* Jetty 9.3 is at M2, not released.
* Full Solr support for HTTP/2 would require more work than just upgrading Jetty. The server configuration would need to change and a new HTTP client ([Jetty's own client|https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/tree/master/jetty-http2], [Square's OkHttp|http://square.github.io/okhttp/], [etc.|https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations]) would need to be selected and wired up. Perhaps this is worthy of a branch?

* multiplexing requests over a single TCP connection ("streams")
* canceling a single request without closing the TCP connection
* removing [head-of-line blocking|https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed]
* header compression

Caveats:
* Jetty 9.3 is at M2, not released.
* Full Solr support for HTTP/2 would require more work than just upgrading Jetty. The server configuration would need to change and a new HTTP client ([Jetty's own client|https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/tree/master/jetty-http2], [Square's OkHttp|http://square.github.io/okhttp/], [etc.|https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations]) would need to be selected and wired up.

Among the HTTP/2 benefits over HTTP/1.1 relevant to Solr are:

* multiplexing requests over a single TCP connection ("streams")
* canceling a single request without closing the TCP connection
* removing [head-of-line blocking|https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed]
* header compression

Caveats:
* Jetty 9.3 is at M2, not released.
* Full Solr support for HTTP/2 would require more work than just upgrading Jetty. The server configuration would need to change and a new HTTP client ([Jetty's own client|https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/tree/master/jetty-http2], [Square's OkHttp|http://square.github.io/okhttp/], [etc.|https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations]) would need to be selected and wired up.

                Yep, we're going to Jetty 9 soon. See SOLR-4839 where I already upgraded to Jetty 9.2 in trunk so that we could go to SPDY but then SPDY was deprecated and HTTP/2 will come out in 9.3. So my next plan is to target 9.3 as soon as it is out and then use Jetty's HTTP client throughout. In the meanwhile, I'll port Jetty 9.2 to 5.x branches after 5.1 is released.

If you don't mind, I will close this issue and we can continue the discussion on SOLR-4839.
              </div></li><li><div>
                My apologies! I didn't realize SOLR-4839 was still open. I have a trunk patch for part of Jetty 9.2-&gt;9.3. Which ticket should I add that to?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hmm, you bring up a good point. You can attach the patch here on this issue itself. I'll link this with SOLR-4839.

I don't think we will push a jetty m2 release to trunk so we can keep SOLR-4839 for the move to 9.2 and then use this issue for the 9.3 upgrade.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Partial patch to move from Jetty 9.2 to 9.3M2. A few tests are fixed but HttpPartitionTest.test stalled out for a few hours and SolrExampleStreamingTest.testUpdateField fails.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks, Shalin. I'll update the ticket title to reflect that this builds on SOLR-4839.

                Oops, this broke the tests because Jetty 9.3 removed the GzipFilter functionality but didn't actually remove the filter class!

SOLR-7339: Disabling testUpdateField until we can fix the underlying issue
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks, [~shalin]! 

Wireshark dumps of SolrExampleStreamingBinaryTest.testUpdateField show Jetty 9.3 sends an RST after the expected "HTTP 409 Conflict" and Jetty 9.2 does not. I haven't figured out what's changed in 9.3 that leads to this, though.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Attached are the Wireshark files for 9.2 (right before the 9.3 commits) and with the 9.3 commits. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The Jetty Project developers took a look at this and ...

If you turn on DEBUG logging for Jetty, you'll see that the test does not send correct data to the server.
The request that fails sends data using chunked encoding, but sends one chunk of length 0x59, but does not send the terminal chunk.
The logs show Jetty reporting that the processing is complete but with unconsumed input, and therefore closes the connection.
Could this be a Solr client bug in disguise?

                Yesterday, I ran the same test using a debugger, and I put a breakpoint at SolrCore.postDecorateResponse's first line (and subsequently I hit resume at every instance of the breakpoint), then the test passes. I suspect there is some timing issue here. I couldn't find anything obvious. Even tried upgrading to the November release of the jetty-server artifacts, same results.

                Thanks [~joakime]. I'll dig into why this is happening. As Ishan pointed out, adding a breakpoint in the test makes it pass so there's a subtle race condition somewhere.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Comparing the debug output from Jetty 9.2.13.v20150730, I see that Solr's behavior has remained the same but Jetty now closes the connection on unconsumed input. I also found that HttpClient by default will retry 3 times when such a thing happens which is clearly not right. Adding params.set(HttpClientUtil.PROP_USE_RETRY, false); to the HttpSolrClient constructor disables those retries. I think we should add that anyway even though it doesn't help fix these failures.

Let's open a separate issue for that. Internal HttpClient usage should be getting an instance setup with the Retry policy that we want. I'm a little skeptical that we just want to hard code it as off in the HttpSolrClient constructor, but perhaps there is something to dig into there.

This upgrade is a bit scary at the moment. I see in one of the repeatable connection reset issues, hard coding the Locale to English for the test makes it pass. Other issues don't seem to relate to the Locale. Unless we can get to the bottom of this quickly, we may want to pull this back and get a handle a better handle on the problems before putting it in.

bq. This upgrade is a bit scary at the moment. I see in one of the repeatable connection reset issues, hard coding the Locale to English for the test makes it pass.

Agreed. Let's give it a day or two. If we can't find the root cause, I will revert this upgrade.

                The above test does not easily replicate for me.

For someone that it does, could you give this patch a shot?

                I moved the method abort call out of 'shouldClose' - it doesn't seem like it should be tied up in that.

I also made it first. I was just kind of guessing on that, but it looks like it should be first according to: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/examples/org/apache/http/examples/client/ClientAbortMethod.java
              </div></li><li><div>
                Mark, I applied your patch and ran the test, but the test still fails with the following output. It appears to be the same as what I saw without your patch, but the exact error isn't clear to me from that output.

                Yeah, I just hit the fail for the first time as well. (with the patch applied).

Thanks for the confirm.

I filed SOLR-8451 for the above change.

                bq. but the exact error isn't clear to me from that output.

It's tripping: assertTrue("ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient did not report an error", concurrentClient.lastError.getMessage().contains("Conflict"));

Is that the same fail as without the patch? I assume so, but just to confirm.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Right, same as without the patch. Here's the relevant part of the log from a run without the patch.

                So that fail seems pretty odd.

We can only hit that fail if: !(client instanceof HttpSolrClient)

And client can only be HttpSolrClient or EmbeddedSolrServer. It should not be EmbeddedSolrServer, because we make a Jetty for this test and presumably a Jetty is involved in this connection reset business. So we really expect that client to be an HttpSolrClient don't we?

So how do we get to this fail message below unless we are using EmbeddedSolrServer?
{code}
      client.add(doc);
      if(client instanceof HttpSolrClient) { //XXX concurrent client reports exceptions differently
        fail("Operation should throw an exception!");
      } else {
        client.commit(); //just to be sure the client has sent the doc
        ErrorTrackingConcurrentUpdateSolrClient concurrentClient = (ErrorTrackingConcurrentUpdateSolrClient) client;
        assertNotNull("ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient did not report an error", concurrentClient.lastError);
        assertTrue("ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient did not report correct error: " + concurrentClient.lastError.getMessage(), concurrentClient.lastError.getMessage().contains("Conflict"));

In a few hours, I can trace through and find out the exact class of the client, and compare with what is the corresponding behaviour on branch_5x for this test.
              </div></li><li><div>
                bq. So that fail seems pretty odd.

Okay, sorry, I thought SolrExampleBinaryTest was hitting this, I was working from the wrong test. It's SolrExampleStreamingBinaryTest. I can't easily reproduce a fail in either one, but I have seen it happen in some test runs.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah, it is ConcurrentHttpSolrClient. The tracked exception in this case is a connection reset exception and not a "Conflict".
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I don't know how to solve this for the general case. Especially for streaming, with this behavior we really need make sure the exception gets set on the response rather than cutting off the request while the client is still sending.

For this particular version issue with this container behavior, you need something like the following instead of throwing an exception, though we probably want something more general and that plays nicer with doFinish:

SolrException e = new SolrException(ErrorCode.CONFLICT, "version conflict for " + cmd.getPrintableId() + " expected=" + versionOnUpdate + " actual=" + foundVersion);;
rsp.setException(e);
return true;
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I filed SOLR-8453 to deal with this SolrExampleStreamingBinaryTest fail issue.
              </div></li><li><div>
                My patch for SOLR-8453 seems to solve pretty much all the connection resets I have been seeing except for the Locale issue. SolrExampleBinaryTest, TestManagedSchemaDynamicFieldResource and a bunch of others can fail with the wrong Locale.
              </div></li><li><div>
                bq. My patch for SOLR-8453 seems to solve pretty much all the connection resets I have been seeing except for the Locale issue.

So this still stands. I think I've solved the general issue with the patch in SOLR-8453. I'm still banging around with it, but it's looking pretty good on my machine.

I still think we probably have to roll this update back because it appears to break Solr under certain default Locales. We should probably try and isolate what is causing it so we can file a bug, but we would still need to wait for a good version.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It's not very often, but I seem to see the following pop up after the update and don't remember it being an issue before (for a long time anyway):

                bq. I still think we probably have to roll this update back because it appears to break Solr under certain default Locales. We should probably try and isolate what is causing it so we can file a bug, but we would still need to wait for a good version.

Makes sense. I'll revert.

bq. Interesting exception in a CollectionsAPIDistributedZkTest fail:

I don't think that is caused by the jetty upgrade because it happens on 5x and 5.4 branches too. I had opened SOLR-8380 to track it.

                We should probably commit that patch - trunk fails are quite noisy now.

I think I've tracked down the other issue in SOLR-8453. I'm thinking it's a Jetty bug. So I think two bugs are currently preventing us from upgrading.

I sent an email to the Jetty dev list to ask about the issue in SOLR-8453.

                Thanks a lot Mark for looking into this. I'll revert the jetty upgrade for now.

SOLR-7339: Revert Jetty 9.3 upgrade
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> bq. The request that fails sends data using chunked encoding, but sends one chunk of length 0x59, but does not send the terminal chunk. The logs show Jetty reporting that the processing is complete but with unconsumed input, and therefore closes the connection.

[~joakime], it appears that the terminal chunk is still coming. Jetty is no longer waiting for it like it previously did. If we speed up how fast we send the terminal chunk, we can get the test to pass. If we slow it down too much, say even by turning on all debug logging, even speeding up how fast we send the terminal chunk is not enough. We basically now have 10-12ms to get that terminal chunk out, where previously Jetty would wait up to other connection timeouts (30 seconds) to get that terminal chunk.

                Mark,

A simple work around could be to install a filter on the server that does read until EOF - ie the filter will ensure that all the content is consumed.  Something like psuedo code:
```java
  doFilter(FilterChain chain, ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)
  {
    try
    {
      chain.doFilter(request,response);
    }
    finally
    {
       consumeAll(request.getInputStream());
    }
```

It may need to be more sophisticated than this is you sometimes use a Reader and/or async IO, but the principal is the same - get the filter to do the behaviour that was in jetty-9.2.    From Jetty's point of view it is the application that can decide to block and wait for this content, so that is OK.

Should I comment on 8453 also? 



              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Yeah, I think we only call sendError in a few places... we could just as easily replace that with another call that consumes any remaining input as well.  We could make it conditional on a query parameter too... this does feel more like a higher level decision (whether to consume all input or not).

                I put up a patch in SOLR-8453. I still have to check and see if the tests that consistently failed on at least 1 locales was also due to this or not.
              </div></li><li><div>
                SOLR-8453  is now committed, I'll check on the Locale issue soon. If that was also somehow related and is no longer a problem, we can go ahead with the update, otherwise we will have to dig in a bit I think.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I just tried this out again and had to file SOLR-8683. I think we can upgrade now though.

                Okay, let's see how this works out...
              </div></li><li><div>
                Darn, sometimes I'm still seeing connection reset problems. But much rarer.
              </div></li><li><div>

              </div></li><li><div>
                Well, at least they are repeatable fails.

Not sure what it is yet, but fails seem to have the following that I don't see in passes:

Option 1)
You have multiple jetty-http.jars, and one of them is really old.
Unfortunately, your system picked the old one over the new one.

Option 2)
You had a fundamental jvm runtime issue preventing that class from being initialized (memory, file descriptors, bad jars, etc..)
Do you have any other log entries that could indicate this sort of issue?

Option 3)
You have a version mismatch between jetty-server.jar and jetty-http.jar

Option 4)
You have jetty-http.jar in your WEB-INF/lib and a testcase that flips the WebAppContext loaderPriority improperly

                [~gregw@webtide.com], [~joakime], looks like a default locale bug:

HttpParser
{code}
            for (String charset : new String[]{"utf-8","iso-8859-1"})
            {
                CACHE.put(new PreEncodedHttpField(HttpHeader.CONTENT_TYPE,type+";charset="+charset));
                CACHE.put(new PreEncodedHttpField(HttpHeader.CONTENT_TYPE,type+"; charset="+charset));
                CACHE.put(new PreEncodedHttpField(HttpHeader.CONTENT_TYPE,type+";charset="+charset.toUpperCase()));
                CACHE.put(new PreEncodedHttpField(HttpHeader.CONTENT_TYPE,type+"; charset="+charset.toUpperCase()));
            }
{code}

toUpperCase should use an ENGLISH locale or I guess our project has determined ROOT is better because ENGLISH could change over time. The turkish bug.

*FYI*

Our project uses this tool to ban default locale method calls: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis

I kicked off Solr tests, but won't check see the results till after I sleep.

Maybe this can make it for 6.0?
