It's a very simple use where you can set cookie_domain in the config which gets put on the set-cookie header.

I couldn't work out where the documentation is to update that and I'm not familiar enough with Erlang to write a test for it but a manual test with and without the config value works fine. If anyone wants to point out how to make a test for it I'm happy enough to put it in if desired.

                Before merging this we'll definitely want to see a test for this.

Can you confirm that this does the right thing on the clustered port (5984)? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I've been using this build myself for dev since making the pull request and it all works as expected on port 5984. 

With the tests I can see how the login is handled easy enough but I can't work out how the server is started since I guess it would have to be restarted with different a config to test the domain gets set on the cookie correctly.

                Hi @almightyju , I'd like to push forward with this. I also want you to get the credit for the change!

You don't have to restart the server with a different config, just change it as part of your `setup()` function, and set it back to the default value in your `teardown()` function. Here's an example:

https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch/test/couchdb_mrview_cors_tests.erl#L32-L57

If you need more guidance, I'm happy to work together with you on this, just let me know.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @wohali, finally got the tests done, I really do dislike erlang :/

Anyway, new tests are passing for me, not confident about the need for clustered and backdoor for this so I've only tested against the clustered port.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Only clustered matters here, the node-local port is deprecated for all communications other than essential system admin tasks.

Looks good! Assuming the Travis changes pass, we can merge this PR.

                Thanks again @almightyju - great job, and congrats on your first-time contribution to Apache CouchDB!

                </div><div><b>description:</b> When using cookies for authentication, there is no "domain" set for the cookie.

This is fine - because this will default the cookie to the domain you accessed it from.

However, if you want to, for example, login to auth.domain.com and then access 1.domain.com, 2.domain.com - your authentication won't be valid as the cookie domain will be auth.domain.com

I'd like to see an option in local.ini to turn on a wildcard cookie. This would set the domain to ".domain.com" which would allow the cookie to work across subdomains. This would default to off and only affect people who want this specific use.

                It's worth mentioning that several other people want this feature (from googling) and there is even a node project as a man in the middle to add this parameter in. See:

                It would be good to see this in. Would a PR on this be accepted?
              </div></li><li><div>
                If it will be submitted - why not? (:

                Class :) Quick one, code is officially handled through Github, right?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Not quite, but you can submit PR via Github, yes.
Please note that for 2.0 main httpd application is located here: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-chttpd/ Configuration files are still in apache/couchdb repo however.
If you're going to make a patch for 1.x series, checkout https://github.com/apache/couchdb/tree/1.x.x/ branch.

If you'll need any help with the patch, build or tests, please ask!
