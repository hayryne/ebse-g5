 * Provides Groovy with functionality similar to the unix tr command
 * which translates a string replacing characters from a source set
 * with characters from a replacement set.

     * Translates a string by replacing characters from the sourceSet with characters from replacementSet.
     * If the first character from sourceSet appears in the string, it will be replaced with the first character from replacementSet.
     * If the second character from sourceSet appears in the string, it will be replaced with the second character from replacementSet.
     * and so on for all provided replacement characters.
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * Here is an example which converts the vowels in a word from lower to uppercase:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * assert 'hello'.tr('aeiou', 'AEIOU') == 'hEllO'
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * A character range using regex-style syntax can also be used, e.g. here is an example which converts a word from lower to uppercase:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * assert 'hello'.tr('a-z', 'A-Z') == 'HELLO'
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * Hyphens at the start or end of sourceSet or replacementSet are treated as normal hyphens and are not
     * considered to be part of a range specification. Similarly, a hyphen immediately after an earlier range
     * is treated as a normal hyphen. So, '-x', 'x-' have no ranges while 'a-c-e' has the range 'a-c' plus
     * the '-' character plus the 'e' character. 
     * &lt;p/&gt;
     * Unlike the unix tr command, Groovy's tr command supports reverse ranges, e.g.:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * assert 'hello'.tr('z-a', 'Z-A') == 'HELLO'
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * If replacementSet is smaller than sourceSet, then the last character from replacementSet is used as the replacement for all remaining source characters as shown here:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * assert 'Hello World!'.tr('a-z', 'A') == 'HAAAA WAAAA!'
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * If sourceSet contains repeated characters, the last specified replacement is used as shown here:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * assert 'Hello World!'.tr('lloo', '1234') == 'He224 W4r2d!'
     * &lt;/pre&gt; 
     * The functionality provided by tr can be achieved using regular expressions but tr provides a much more compact
     * notation and efficient implementation for certain scenarios.
     *
     * @param   self the string that is to be translated
     * @param   sourceSet the set of characters to translate from
     * @param   replacementSet the set of replacement characters
     * @return  The resulting translated &lt;tt&gt;String&lt;/tt&gt;
     * @see org.codehaus.groovy.util.StringUtil#tr(String, String, String)

                </div><div><b>description:</b> Unix has a 'tr' translation command. It would be good for Groovy to support something similar.
Translations similar to what 'tr' does can be achieved using regular expressions but the
notation required is much more compact and the implementation can be much more efficient.

                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                It was more to get around the fact that implementation is in Groovy so isn't compiled in current build in time for DGM - but no doubt could be reworked.
              </div></li><li><div>
                tr command added to DGM
