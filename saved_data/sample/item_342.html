Makes a protective copy of the master's migrations, when requested, to prevent

Likewise for me. I thought I remembered seeing other immutable wrappers in the Master similar to your change, but there's nothing wrong with this as-is.

                My thinking is that we don't expect the caller to modify it.  Now that a copy is made, its ok if caller modifies.  But if in the future the implementation uses a concurrent map and does not copy, would not want caller of method to modify.  Also the previous implementation didn't expect caller to modify, just read.

It just seems an unnecessary restriction to me.

It's internal-only code, so we can change it any way we like in the future... and I think the risk you're highlighting is lower than the risk of somebody accidentally calling an unsupported method... and it's also much easier to protect against at the time the implementation changes. If it changes from a protective copy to another implementation, I would think it'd be obvious for the implementor to check to see if that breaks usage at that time.

For now, I think it makes sense to treat the interface as "snapshot of migrations", and the protective copy (vs. another implementation) matches up to that interface semantics. We could change the interface method name to "migrationsSnapshot()" to be clear, though, and to avoid careless future impl changes which change that semantics.

Yup, Saw the same exact thing over here.

                Possibly. A solution seems to be to make the master just provide a protective copy of the keySet.
