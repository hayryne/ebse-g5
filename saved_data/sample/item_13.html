                Regarding backport risk (cc [~lhofhansl] [~stack]).

This JarFinder utility has been in Hadoop for 18 months. Grep indicates is it used primarily by the MiniMRYarnCluster, which has seen a good deal of exercise in that time. Unfortunately, the only way to test this is via MR jobs run on distributed clusters, and our test automation doesn't cover this very well right now. I don't (yet) have a suite of MR jobs to act as a test battery.

All this patch does is change the common code-patch to match the hadoop-0.23 codepath, as introduced in HBASE-5317. That patch shipped with 0.92.1. I think if there were issues we'd know about them by now.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Looks safe to backport IMO.

                Maybe we can backport this, but still keep old findContainingJar(), and fall back to it. Smt like:
 - Try to locate JarFinder in the classpath, if found use it 
 - Try backported JarFinder 
 - If everything fails fallback to findContainingJar(). 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I see what you're saying, but your order of operations is off. I think you mean:
- Try to locate JarFinder in the classpath, if found use it. (current behavior)
- Try existing findContainingJar. (current behavior)
- Fall back to backported JarFinder. (new behavior)
              </div></li><li><div>
                I though we might want to try the backported JarFinder first, but both should work. As long as the failure condition for both of them is "find the jar, throw exception, or return null" (vs finding a wrong jar), the ordering should not affect correctness. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                JarFinder will build a jar from class files if a packages jar cannot be located. I believe the preference is to use an existing packaged jar over bundling one for the run. Hence, actually invoking it should be a last resort. This was *not* the behavior before I touched this bit of code ;)
              </div></li><li><div>
                bq. JarFinder will build a jar from class files if a packages jar cannot be located
I see, lets do it in your order then. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Trunk should also be updated to match this behavior..?
              </div></li><li><div>
                bq. Trunk should also be updated to match this behavior..?
I don't think so. If JarFinder is good at finding the jars, we should not need it. I proposed keeping it safe for 0.94. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The logic here is dumb! We should give priority to the common case, not the broken MRv2 test scenario.

According to the existing comment around JarFinder, it was only needed on hadoop-0.23 for test cases. Indeed, JarFinder came out of hadoop-0.23 test code. Based on the that comment alone, it's not clear to me if MRv2 will ship the jar in the common case. I suggest the logic be:

# try use existing {{findContainingJar}}. This will provide for normal MRv1 jobs (and maybe normal MRv2 jobs).
# try use Backported {{JarFinder}}. This will provide for MRv1 "HCat Scenario" jobs, MRv2 test jobs (and maybe normal MRv2 jobs).
# throw exception. It should fail configuring the job if the desired dependency cannot be found.
              </div></li><li><div>
                That is a shame. Hadoop should provide jar shipping utilities. Even JobConf.setJarByClass() uses findContainingJar(). Let's open a MAPREDUCE ticket, and get this util as a part of the public API. (independent of this ticket)
              </div></li><li><div>

              </div></li><li><div>
                This version applies the logic I described:

# try using findContainingJar.
# try backported JarFinder.
# throw.

                In HADOOP-9426, we are trying to make JarFinder be a public main API. In this case, should not we still search for the JarFinder in the classpath, and only failover to backport as a last stand? 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> If we backport this in HBase, then why should we try to find it in Hadoop first? It will be a bit duplicate, no? It's the same code. Or do we have a longterm plan to remove this when all Hadoop versions will contain HADOOP-9426?

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                [~enis] I'm a little concerned about feature drift between the forks, but the svn log indicates this class hasn't been touched much by Hadoop, so the likelihood is low. My preference is to explicitly use this version over using reflection to resolve one at run-time.

[~jmspaggi] My preference is to delete any backports from HBase code once our support matrix of hadoop versions carries the necessary features.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I have an updated patch. Rebased, and resolving JarFinder via reflection per [~enis]'s comment. Testing it locally is a PITA because the integration test (HBASE-8147) isn't back-ported to 0.94. Will post shortly (I hope).
              </div></li><li><div>
                The logic seems good. However, in case we fall back to backport JarFinder, we shouldn't be accessing it through reflection. Can you just add the import and do a direct call. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                This patch uses reflection only for hadoop's jarfinder.

The exact logic in the patch seems to be now: 
 (1) Try existing findContainingJar.
 (2) Try to locate JarFinder in the classpath, if found use it.
 (3) Fall back to backported JarFinder.

There is a reordering of steps 1 and 2 in the patch compared to current code, but it should not make a difference.

                +1 from me as well.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I have two +1's, yet [~lhofhansl] is conspicuously absent regarding the 0.94 backport. [~stack], [~apurtell], do you have an opinion for 0.96/trunk?
              </div></li><li><div>
                The trunk/0.95 patch is not factored for hadoop-compat and this seems like the sort of compatibility issue that was designed for. For 0.94 reflection makes sense. For 0.95+, the same code in hadoop-compat-1 makes sense, for hadoop-compat-2 we can assume JarFinder is there since Hadoop 2 code is &gt;= 0.23. 

I would commit this to 0.94 (ping [~lhofhansl]) and maybe take it on the chin if there's test issues :-) because the patch looks good, the work on this issue looks good, and there has been good review. However I would like to hold off until a change goes in through trunk first. Please let me know your thoughts on the above comment.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Another way of stating the above is: Since this is a backport what is up with the trunk parity patch? Why is it not factored for hadoop-compat?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Further development when into this patch than in the initial version on trunk. Notably, the precise order of class look-up for jar discovery is eventually different on this ticket than what went into trunk, hence the parity patch.

Trouble is, JarFinder isn't actually provided by released hadoop yet, on any version. It might be on the classpath in a test jar, but not in a production deployment. IMHO, the reflection code should not have been added as it was, because it was a work-around for a broken test environment.

We now have a legitimate use-case for this same code-path, hence it gaining some new attention.

I'll take a look at the hadoop-compat modules on 0.95/trunk and see if I can make sense of a variation, update the parity patch accordingly. The 0.94 patch still applies. We'll still need to ship the backported JarFinder for 1.x hadoops and, unless HADOOP-9426 squeezes in soon, for early releases of the 2.x line as well.
