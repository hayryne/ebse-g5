                There are a bunch of links pointing to a personal repo instead of dmlc/web-data. Please replace those.

The rest LGTM.

                It would be helpful for users to include some discussion of the common errors that they see e.g. when there's a tensor shape mismatch between layers of a NN. If we included the actual error message then people would find this tutorial when they Googled for the error message. This would segue nicely to the example where you show how you can't just perform these operations to make the error go away; you have to actually know what you're doing.

For users who already know what tensor reshaping is, the information they need (the "how" rather than the "why") is in a few non-obvious places. Maybe add something near the top with pointers to ndarray docs for more comprehensive documentation: https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/basic/ndarray.html

Some of the cases of users asking about mismatch errors on the discussion forum might give good background for the confusion of people who are new to such operations.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I added more examples e.g. common pitfalls and errors 
I also changed a couple of minor things.

                LGTM.

@NRauschmayr Could you trigger the CI again?

@simoncorstonoliver @ThomasDelteil for another round of review

                can you please reverify this image. Transposing this
```
[[ 1.  2.  3.  4.]
 [ 5.  6.  7.  8.]
 [ 9. 10. 11. 12.]]
```
returns the following - 
```
[[ 1.  5.  9.]
 [ 2.  6. 10.]
 [ 3.  7. 11.]
 [ 4.  8. 12.]]
```
But your diagram does not reflect that.

                can you show the result of the print statement.

                the documentation does not describe what `-2` and `-3` values does. Can this tutorial describe where and how those values are used with reshape. For example, is it with video data where we have 5-d arrays etc..
              </div></li><li><div>
                This shows as just text, it should be a clickable link. 

But a bigger point is I don't think we need this section at all. Can these two documentation links be added as a hyperlink to the first occurrence of the terms "Reshape" and "Transpose" at the beginning of the tutorial and remove this section.

You are saying that, "go to the the documentation for more details" but I think this tutorial contains more details than the documentation. :)

can you also please update your PR description with this link - http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13208/3/tutorials/basic/reshape_transpose.html. It will help reviewers, especially when reviewing tutorials.

                Hi @NRauschmayr , There's also another way of pushing an empty commit in case you need to re-trigger the CI. 
You can try ```git commit --allow-empty -m "&lt;commit-message&gt;"``` :)
