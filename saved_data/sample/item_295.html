- Add variable to test PARQUET_1_0 format

- Add annotation to display AverageTime. The Throughput mode was always displaying less than 1 op/s. So I thought time was a better mode here.

@nezihyigitbasi @danielcweeks You did a good job starting the parquet-benchmarks module. Could you please review these changes?

                Thanks @nezihyigitbasi for the feedback.
I fixed the issues you mentioned. You will be able to generate data this time.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks @nezihyigitbasi 
I added the changes based on your feedback. I liked your explanation about random data, so I replaced the old paragraph with yours.

I tried to figured out why the benchmark cannot be executed when compiling with hadoop-2, but I did not know why. So, I just replace the README to use the command with out the profile.

One thing. The read-benchmark.sh tests will fail when using parquetVersion=v2 and randomData=true due to the issue in PARQUET-152. If the patch is applied, then all tests run fine. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                @spena To keep the fixes to the existing benchmark module separate I created a new PR: https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/226

Yep I verified that your change makes the read-benchmark go through. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                @spena I only added a few minor comments to the README. Other than that LGTM. 
@rdblue I have provided feedback to @spena and verified his changes. When he addresses my final comments this patch LGTM. It's all yours now.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks @nezihyigitbasi.
I added the minor changes you mentioned.

Once #226 is committed, I will merge the code to my branch, and check it is applied correctly.

              </div></li><li><div>
                @nezihyigitbasi @rdblue 
I updated the branch with the latest changes of master (includes #226).

No more work to do here.

                why only average time? I think we can do `Mode.ALL` to get as many metrics as possible, which may provide useful info.

                Is `randomData` optional? When I only specify the version to generate some data (with a command that looks like `.... org.apache.parquet.benchmarks.DataGenerator generate v2`) I get an exception

``` Java

                Seems like to generate data I _have to_ specify `-randomData`, then why is that a cmd line flag at all? I tried a few command line args to see how it behaves
- `java -cp ${SCRIPT_PATH}/target/parquet-benchmarks.jar org.apache.parquet.benchmarks.DataGenerator generate`

```
Generating test data ---&gt; This shouldn't be printed btw.
Usage: generate VERSION [-randomData]

Options:
  VERSION         Use a specific parquet file version to generate data.
                  - v1 for PARQUET_1_0 version.
                  - v2 for PARQUET_2_0 version.
  -randomData     This flag specifies if random data will be used to generate data.
                  By default, only 1 random row is generated, and repeated across the file.
```
- `java -cp ${SCRIPT_PATH}/target/parquet-benchmarks.jar org.apache.parquet.benchmarks.DataGenerator generate v2`

                I don't know what has changed in the mean time, but with the `hadoop-2` profile now the generated parquet-benchmarks jar doesn't contain `/META-INF/BenchmarkList` and it fails

A build without specifying any profile creates a valid jar though. So build command should be

```
mvn --projects parquet-benchmarks -amd -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip=true clean package
```

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Would be nice to rephrase this &amp; clarify a little bit. How about something like:

```
While creating a test Parquet file of N records, by default all benchmarks use a single record 
that's repeated N times throughout the file. To have a larger number of random records in 
this test file you can specify `randomData=true` -- with this flag 100K random records 
are generated and used repeatedly while creating the test file. 
```

                </div><div><b>description:</b> The current parquet-benchmarks module run some performance tests between different block &amp; page sizes for PARQUET_2_0 version only.

Also, this module uses repeated data to benchmark the settings. We should also use random data to get different results about how current and new encodings work with real world data.
