                @gszadovszky , thanks for your review. I'd like to rebase this to master before merging. Maybe it needs your another look again. Thanks in advance!

                @gszadovszky @Fokko, I just realized that you may need squashing for this PR, so it would be better to submit a separated PR for merging master.  So please help to merge this in your convenience. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                So you'll create a new PR from `bloom-filter` to `master`? I'm fine with that. @gszadovszky WDYT?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @Fokko, I may put in the wrong way, but it is a PR to merge master to bloom-filter branch. I have done that job local machine and can submit that if you prefer to squash one more merging PR. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Let's squash+merge this PR to the feature branch first. Then, check the merge PR and push it to the feature branch as well. 
If everything is ready, create a PR from the feature branch to master. There shall be no conflicts. After the final review/tests succeed squash+merge the whole to master.

                What happens if this product overflows? How does that behavior compare to this line operating on unsigned values in C++, which cannot overflow on multiplication?

                The number of blocks right shift 5 bits at first, so its value should be less than `1&lt;&lt;27` and the overflow should not happen here.

                Sure, I will add to `HashStrategy` definition.

                Why don't we use `Set&lt;String&gt;`? It generates compile time warnings since generics is introduced.
              </div></li><li><div>
                `ParquetWriter.Builder` is to be used from code. I think, it would be more usable if we would expect varargs of strings or we would have a different method that can add column names one-by-one.
