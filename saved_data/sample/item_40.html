Enable deep-iteration option when print-data-log is enabled in DumpLogSegments. Otherwise data is not printed.

                </div><div><b>body:</b> Enable deep-iteration option when print-data-log is enabled in `DumpLogSegments`. Otherwise data is not printed. System test was wrongly reporting that data was lost since no payloads were printed.

                Was this a regression?
              </div></li><li><div>
                It has been like this for quite some time. This didn't cause the system test failure. The test failed because some messages were not consumed in time. But the system test logs report that acked messages were lost since they were not in the logs, when they were in fact in the logs and DumpLogSegments simply did not print them out.

                @hachikuji Thanks for the review. I have added a note to `upgrade notes`.

                Any chance we could have a test for this?

                @ijuma Thanks for the review. Added a test.

                @hachikuji Thanks for the review, will rebase and merge to trunk and 1.1.

                Do you think we should also imply deep iteration if a message decoder is provided explicitly?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @hachikuji `printDataLog` is already automatically set if decoders are provided. So this will enable deep iteration in that case.

                Ah, you're right. I was looking for it in the logic below when constructing the message parser.
