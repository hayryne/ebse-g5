We can see that hfile_1 have been committed twice and the second call will fail and cause the test timeout.

I'm not sure if it is a issue of AsyncRpcClient. But if I use RpcClientImpl, the test always passes.

                Thanks for digging in [~Apache9] You think this one failing on trunk only where asyncrpcclient is enabled? Looking at branch-1, I don't see it failing (looked at about last ten builds). Let me commit the latest TestChoreService fixup. Then the TestLoadIncrementalHFiles signal might be cleaner.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~stack] Yes, only see it failing on master. And I tried locally, it is very easy to hang.
I switched to RpcClientImpl and run it several times, all passed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Add some log.
Now I can confirm that, when timeout happen, ProtobufUtil.bulkLoadHFile is called twice, but RpcServer receives three request, hfile_1 is received twice.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Almost there. I think I found a data race.

In AsyncRpcChannel.startHBaseConnection, we will call writeRequest when connect operation complete to write out all pendingCalls.
But at the same time, AsyncRpcChannel.callMethod will put call to pendingCalls, and then call writeRequest.

So there could a situation, one call is written out twice.

Any suggestion on how to fix it? [~stack] , [~jurmous]

IMHO, the locking schema is not clear in AsyncRpcClient and AsyncRpcChannel. Maybe we need to revisit it and use some standard locking method? Thanks~

                Ah yes, I can see the problem you are describing looking at the code. Thanks for chasing it down!

I would suggest a simple boolean lock on the Call itself when it starts to be written. Since a call can be written only once and if the write fails the whole channel is closed it seems the most straightforward route. Other suggestions are welcome!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I would suggest to use a lock to make 'check connection state' and 'put call to pendingCalls' atomic.

This is easy to implement and easy to understand, and can also solve the problem of HBASE-12951.

                Yes true, I am open to review any patches implementing your suggestion!
              </div></li><li><div>
                OK, I will try to prepare a patch these days.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for digging in [~Apache9] (and [~jurmous] for input)
              </div></li><li><div>
                Use a lock to get correctness.
This could a baseline. If we found the lock is bottleneck, then we can focus on optimize it.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Oh, there is a patch already.
IMHO, the patch does not work...Certainly this patch could reduce the probability of writing one call twice, but it can not prevent all...
Let's see
t1 check call.writeLock, it is false
t2 check call.writeLock, it is still false
t1 set call.writeLock to true and writeRequest
t2 set call.writeLock to true and writeRequest
OK, call is written twice...

Of course there are synchronization methods that could work without a lock, but these methods are all complicated I'd say...

                TestHMasterRPCException is flakey. I think the problem is the test itself.

The test try to connect to HMaster several times until it getting ServerNotRunningYetException.
But we do not set any guard to prevent HMaster transfering its state to running, so it could happen that when we successfully connect to HMaster, it is already under the running state(especially on heavy loaded machines)...

And I can not view the log file of other failed tests, maybe something wrong with jenkins? I ran these tests locally, they all passed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~Apache9] Reviewed the code and looks great to me. 

The logs are findable within the artifacts page on the overview page of the jenkins build. For example for the failed TestTableSnapshotScanner:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/12815/artifact/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestTableSnapshotScanner-output.txt

The patch was indeed not sufficient for all cases. I am glad you did the work that needed to be done!

I had the same problem with the tests that failed that I couldn't reproduce them locally. Same with TestLoadIncrementalHFiles so I am happy you found the problem here. :)
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~jurmous] Thanks for the artifacts link. I found this

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/12815/artifact/hbase-server/target/surefire-reports/org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.TestTableSnapshotScanner.txt

Seems the test is passed.

So the only problem is TestHMasterRPCException . I can file a new jira to address it.
