              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> +1 on the intent.  I find that highly unintuitive.

                Does this mean that a simple mouse hover along the queue icons wont change updated value in below table, rather you have to do a single click to get this?
              </div></li><li><div>
                That's my read of it.  I find the new UI counter-intuitive in that no other UIs I use trigger an action based on a hover.  With the new UI I always click on the queue to select it and then have to use the back button to get back because clicking unexpectedly takes me to the queue-specific page.  In a UI, the general contract is that hover gives pop-up info, click selects, and double-click enters.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think i am fine with this. But cursor has to change as a HAND icon so that user will get a perspective that this is clickable ,also with same queue icon expand feel. [~ayousufi], I guess this can be done easily as its already available. correct?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for the feedback everyone.

[~sunilg] Yes, that's correct. I'll upload a patch with that change shortly.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hey [~sunilg], I just checked and the cursor does change to a hand when you hover over a node. Should it do something else in addition?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yea. This behavior seems fine enough for now i think.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I ll commit this patch later today if there are no objection.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~ayousufi], sorry for a last minute hiccup. When i click (single), below contents are changing. But the surrounding effect for queue node happening only when i click one more. (not double click, 2 separate single clicks). 
I think this is something different issue. May be we can track is different in new jira and get this committed. Thoughts ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah that sounds like a different issue to me. I think a new jira for that is a good idea. Thanks [~sunilg].
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks. Please help to raise a new issue. 
I ll commit this shortly.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Committed to trunk. Thanks [~ayousufi]
