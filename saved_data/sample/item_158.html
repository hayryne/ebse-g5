{code}
        Reader reader = new FileReader(signatureSecretFile);
        int c = reader.read();
        while (c &gt; -1) {
          secret.append((char) c);

        }
        reader.close();
{code}
If IOException is thrown out of reader.read(), reader would be left unclosed.

1. Indent is breaking.
{code}
-        throw new RuntimeException(
-            "Could not read HTTP signature secret file: "
+          throw new RuntimeException(
+              "Could not read HTTP signature secret file: "
