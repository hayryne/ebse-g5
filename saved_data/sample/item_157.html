                I uploaded PDF about the proposed features of Ozone 0.2.1 release. It's just a proposal, please comment it.

Looks like you are trying to voice some concerns in a voiceless manner. If you do see any issue we would be more than willing to address it. Please let us know what you are concerned about more clearly. We do build and deploy the bits regularly with *mvn package* and deploy both HDFS only and Ozone bits in an internal cluster. So yes, from a pragmatic point of view, we think this is feasible. I realize that we may not share the same point of view when looking at these issues, so please let us know if you see any issues, so we can address them.

Good catch, we should document the Hadoop release process changes. I remember there was a thread some time back that the release process is *not* correct. if you can point us to the correct Hadoop release process document, we would be more than happy to document the release changes and process needed.

This is the Jira that is proposing the actual release and hopefully the conversation in this Jira will allow us to nail it down. Please take a look at the attached design document of what we want to achieve, if there are no concerns, we will document how to get there.

                bq.  if you can point us to the correct Hadoop release process document

This pretty much answers all of my questions.  :(

maybe this is an opportunity for us to look at the release process scripts and document them? I am willing to document both Hadoop release and Ozone release process. [~aw] I don't have your level of expertise on Hadoop release or the history, would you be able to review and correct the mistakes that I make? Then we can use this as an opportunity to address this issue.

                We created an ozone-0.2 branch for the 0.2.x releases of ozone.

The current problem with the dependency between ozone and hadoop-3.2-SNAPSHOT is not fully solved. I propose to skip the publish of the artifacts to the apache nexus. (The official release artifact is the source release anyway). In the binary release we will have some hadoop artifacts (common/hdfs-server) with a specific version (ozone-0.2.1), but the ozone distribution is not enough to start hadoop components (hdfs/yarn).
