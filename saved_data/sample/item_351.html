                I'm including this in 1.6.0 RC3, because it helped me find ACCUMULO-2700.

                This will just be running findbugs and not fixing outstanding issues, correct?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Right. If there's any other serious issues found while it's running, I'll create a separate ticket for them, and fix them so this passes. It's initially going to have a very high threshold (only very serious issues). We can lower that over time, as we clean up some of the less serious issues (bad practices) and add non-issues to a skip list.

                The maxRank is set to 1 in this fix, to limit issues to only the highest rank. This can be gradually lowered to something reasonable in future tickets, to catch gradually less serious issues (maybe even all the way down to 20, to include everything).
