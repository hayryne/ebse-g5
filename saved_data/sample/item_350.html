 * A simple configuration wrapper for Apache Commons configuration. The implementation supports
 * reading and writing properties style config and interpolation.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This simple wrapper was created to keep 3rd party APIs out of the Fluo API.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0

                </div><div><b>body:</b> I have been experimenting with classloaders to separate the Fluo frameworks dependencies from application dependencies which executing Observers.   One thing I have realized as part of this experimenting is that having commons config in the API makes this dependency isolation more difficult.  It forces the Fluo and a Fluo user to have the same commons config.  In order to support the possibility of  dependency isolation in the future  I think it would be best if FluoConfiguration encapsulated commons config instead of extending it.   Also need to check if public API uses any other 3rd party types.
