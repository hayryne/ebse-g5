                I'm trying to understand when would we hit this while state is neither Done nor FAILED. What is being protected by having this check?

                not sure whether we have logged the entire pipeline option somewhere. Otherwise it would be good to have a log entry here about which execution environment we're running

                Oh, the status can be RUNNING, since it can be a timed waifForFinish().
