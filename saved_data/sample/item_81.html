                </div><div><b>description:</b> An API to watch for changes to collection state would be a generally useful thing, both internally and for client use.
                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Patch outlining the basic idea.

This adds two new interfaces, CollectionStateWatcher and CollectionStatePredicate.  The first can be registered for a particular collection with ZkStateReader and is called when the state of that collection changes (as determined by the internal watcher of that collection's state.json node).  The second is used in a new ZkStateReader.waitForState() method, and is called on a state change to see if the state of a collection matches a predicate.  There are also forwarding methods on CloudSolrClient for use by SolrJ clients, and a couple of helper methods on DocCollection and Replica to easily check for collection liveness.

The new interfaces lend themselves nicely to use as Java 8 functional interfaces, and the TestCollectionStateWatchers test demonstrate both lambdas and method references here.

This should make it easy to replace some of the helper methods (eg waitForThingsToLevelOut, waitForRecoveriesToFinish) in our tests with methods available to SolrJ.

A caveat: this is only implemented for collections with their own state.json.  I think it should be relatively easy to extend it to stateformat=1 collections as well if people think that's worth it.

That one is pretty test specific.

Someone should remove stateformat=1 for Solr 6 in an ideal world.

                bq. Someone should remove stateformat=1 for Solr 6 in an ideal world

Absolutely.  Maybe this new API should just go into trunk for now?  If Solr 6 is coming early in the new year it makes sense to start adding things that don't need to worry about back-compatibility.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Updated patch, using the SolrCloudTestCase from SOLR-8758.

This has required a couple of tweaks to the collection-watching code in ZkStateReader, to allow for watching of non-existent collections.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> - Why is DocCollection.isFullyActive() static?

bq. stateWatchers.putIfAbsent(collection, Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()));

 - You want computeIfAbsent() here to avoid the allocations.

- If waitForState() exits with the TimeoutException, the watcher never gets removed.

- There is a fundamental problem with how interestingCollections is getting managed now; there are external controls on that set, but now it's mixed up with the CollectionStateWatcher API.  As an example, CollectionStateWatcher adds but never removes; and an external caller could call removeZkWatcher on a collection that there's a listener for.

- The way the code is structured with setCreationWatch and refreshAndWatch doesn't make sense to me. Why in the heck are they recursive?  I don't think you need all this.  I suspect what you really want is to move the call to notifyStateWatchers() and handle it more intelligently to not fire events if the state hasn't actually changed.  Basically, you want to call notifyStateWatchers() from within updateWatchedCollection() exactly at the 3 points we're emitting log messages.

bq. Why is DocCollection.isFullyActive() static?

Because the DocCollection passed to onStateChanged() may be null if the collection doesn't exist, or has been deleted.

bq. If waitForState() exits with the TimeoutException, the watcher never gets removed.

Fixed.

bq. Basically, you want to call notifyStateWatchers() from within updateWatchedCollection() exactly at the 3 points we're emitting log messages

Done, thanks - that's considerably simpler.

bq. There is a fundamental problem with how interestingCollections is getting managed now

I've restructured this entirely.  Watches keep track of a) how many cores they have interested in them, and b) how many state watchers there are.  Changes to a CollectionWatch state are always done inside a ConcurrentHashMap.compute() method to keep them atomic.  This simplifies the watch handling in ZKController as well, and removes the abstraction leak where external objects controlled when to remove watches.

                unregisterCore needs a better guard against under-referencing, since it can be called from the outside.
A caller could call unregisterCore enough times to make coreRefCount negative, offsetting a positive stateWatchers.size() and prematurely removing.
Might even be advisable to throw an exception here on under reference.

                In notifyStateWatchers you can avoid some copies but just re-assigning the instance variable to a new empty set, and taking ownership of the existing set to fire events on.

bq. Could collectionWatches and interestingCollections be unified into a single thing?

Unfortunately not, as it's needed to detect collections which have migrated from state format 1 to state format 2.  There's almost certainly a nicer way of doing that, though - maybe in a follow-up issue?

bq. make the static type of collectionWatchers be ConcurrentMap?

I disagree here - we don't use any of the concurrent methods, so I think just using Map is fine?

bq. unregisterCore needs a better guard against under-referencing

Added.  I don't think throwing an exception is necessary, although maybe we should log a warning in this case?

bq. newState is always null

changed

bq. No need to early exit here

changed

bq. In notifyStateWatchers you can avoid some copies...

I think this ends up as a wash, given that you may end up creating multiple HashSets?  And we're only copying references, after all.

bq. In getStateWatchers() you probably still want to wrap in a compute function...

Compute() doesn't help here, I don't think?  And given that it's a test-only method, I'm not too concerned about accuracy.  I've made it return a copy rather than return the original set, which should stop weird things happening to it once it's been returned, though.

bq. fetchCollectionState() expectExists parameter doesn't make sense to me

Again, this is due to state format 1 - a collection state might be in clusterstate.json, so the collection-specific state might not exist.  I agree about the null watcher though, and have added a check around the exists call for that.

bq. registerCore/ unregisterCore should probably retain the previous doc:

Added back

bq. getStateWatchers() could return null vs. empty set

Nice idea, added.

I've also added an explicit test for state format 1 collections, and updated the code so that it actually works :)

    I just want to toss out an idea here after looking at this some more.  I notice that CollectionStateWatcher and CollectionStatePredicate are nearly identical.  What would you think about combining the two into a single interface?
    
    The signature could be e.g.:
    
    bool stateChanged(liveNodes, collectionState)
    
    In a watch context, the return value means "keep watching?".  So return true to reset the watcher and continue getting updates, or return false to stop watching.
    
    In a predicate context, the return value means "keep waiting?".  So return true to keep waiting, or return false if you've finally seen what you were waiting for.
    
    They'll both have the same semantic meaning either way.

    The reason I made a comment about using the concrete type here is that it makes it much easier to work with as a developer.  When you can see that the static type of this variable is ConcurrentHashMap, that helps you evaluate the code that touches it.
    
    For example, when you use IDE features to 'click through' a method call or view the javadoc on a called method, you get the ConcurrentHashMap version of the javadoc/method instead of the Map version, which helps you more easily evaluate the correctness.

    @shalinmangar this is what I was referring to, I know you're working on getting Overseer to not peg ZK polling for state changes on unwatched collections, this PR provides an easy mechanism to temporarily watch collections of interest.

    I think we could tighten this code up to ensure that predicate never gets call concurrently from two different threads at the same time, this would simplify things for clients and handle the case of calling it twice when it succeeds immediately.

    I think we should pass in liveNodes; particularly in cases where we're firing a bunch of watchers, or even firing watchers on a bunch of collections at once, we can avoid the repeated volatile reads.

    Looking good, a little more high-level feedback.  @shalinmangar I think you should take a look also.
    
    Have you run the tests extensively?  The first time I ran I got a failure, but after that it's been fairly reliable, but I haven't beasted.

    TBH, I don't think getZkStateReader() *should* be a public method - client code that's using CloudSolrClient shouldn't need to interact with low-level stuff like the state reader.  Maybe we only need to expose waitForState() here though.

    I'm not talking about concurrent calls here, rather it's the race between adding the watcher, checking if the predicate matches the current state, and state changes arriving.
    
    There are two scenarios here (T1 = client thread, Z1 = zkCallback thread):
    
    T1 -&gt; watcher added
    Z1 -&gt; state changes, watcher called
    T1 -&gt; watcher called for initial check
    
    Or, if we do things the other way round
    T1 -&gt; watcher called for initial check and doesn't trigger
    Z1 -&gt; state changes
    T1 -&gt; watcher added, but isn't updated
    
    Absent adding locks all over the place, which I'm really reluctant to do here as it would be far too easy to end up in a deadlock, I think we have to accept that a predicate may get called twice.  I don't think it matters too much though?  This is generally just going to be used for waiting.

    It seems like it would be nice to shield callers from doing any kind of similar mutexing.  If you don't want to bother right now, I can come back and see if I can do something not yucky looking here.

    I just realized you don't want to call user code while holding the update lock.  I think you're going to need to move this out of the synchronized block.  In fact.... this is really nasty now that I think about it.  In general, you're going to want to defer calling any user code until the current constuctState() operation finishes.  Otherwise, the user code is potentially going to see a stale copy of the state that you haven't finished updating yet.
    
    I think we're going to have to build a queue of outstanding state watchers to notify and always call them later, probably in an executor.  I know that sounds like a bit of work, but I'm not sure I can see how it would be safe otherwise.
    
    @markrmiller any thoughts?

Is it necessary to create a branch on some other/personal repo and then issue a pull request (as was done here I see) or is it possible for someone to review commits to a branch on our repo/mirror?  I'm thinking SOLR-5750 -- https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commits/solr-5750   (feel free to make a comment to test).

    @romseygeek nice job on the changes so far, and sorry to have so much feedback and so many asks.  This is a pretty complicated change so I feel like it merits the attention to detail.
    
    I feel like we're at a fork in the road with this patch at the moment though, and we need to get more people involved to proceed.  Let me explain.
    
    Even having fixed the "calling watchers while holding locks issue", the one thing that makes me most nervous about the current state is that we're still potentially executing user-provided predicates on threads that belong to a variety of other people-- e.g. the caller of forceUpdateCollection() or even the Zk event callback thread.  We could make a tactical fix to the implementation of waitForState() by turning that method into a loop and running the predicate on the actual thread that called waitForState(), such that the onStateChanged() handler doesn't dip into client code.
    
    But honestly, I feel like having privatized CollectionStateWatcher and the ability to register / unregister is a missed opportunity.  I can think of uses for the feature, like in some cases Overseer operations could watch a collection for the duration of an operation to prevent having to re-query ZK.  To make that solid, we'd need to either introduce an Executor in ZkStateReader for publishing events, or else require the watch registration to provide an executor, the way Guava's ListenableFuture does.
    
    Thoughts?  I'd also like to hear from others.

    Feedback is good :-)
    
    I'll pull CSW back out and make it public again.  I think keeping it separate from the Predicate is still a useful distinction though.  I'll try adding in an executor as well.

    BTW, here's an implementation of waitForState() that does the work on the calling thread.  This passes your tests:
    
    ```
      public void waitForState(final String collection, long wait, TimeUnit unit, CollectionStatePredicate predicate)
          throws InterruptedException, TimeoutException {
        long stop = System.nanoTime() + unit.toNanos(wait);
    
        if (predicate.matches(this.liveNodes, clusterState.getCollectionOrNull(collection))) {
          return;
        }
    
        LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Pair&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;, DocCollection&gt;&gt; queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;();
        CollectionStateWatcher watcher = new CollectionStateWatcher() {
          @Override
          public void onStateChanged(Set&lt;String&gt; liveNodes, DocCollection collectionState) {
            queue.add(new Pair&lt;&gt;(liveNodes, collectionState));
            registerCollectionStateWatcher(collection, this);
          }
        };
    
        registerCollectionStateWatcher(collection, watcher);
        try {
          while (true) {
            Pair&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;, DocCollection&gt; pair = queue.poll(stop - System.nanoTime(), TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);
            if (pair == null) {
              throw new TimeoutException();
            }
            if (predicate.matches(pair.getKey(), pair.getValue())) {
              return;
            }
          }
        } finally {
          removeCollectionStateWatcher(collection, watcher);
        }
      }
    ```
    
    One thing I noticed in writing this is that it's uncertain whether you'll miss any states or not.  I kind of like the idea that you could have your watcher return true or false to decide whether to keep watching, as it would ensure we could get all updates without missing any.

    &gt; One thing I noticed in writing this is that it's uncertain whether you'll miss any states or not
    
    Unless I'm misunderstanding you, this is just how ZK works, though.  A watcher firing just means that there has been at least one change to the watched node in the space of the last tick.  So we wouldn't be able to guarantee that the CollectionStateWatcher is notified of every change.
    
    If we're making CSW public again, I don't think the queueing implementation you have there will work?  An executor seems to be the most straightforward way of doing things here.  Although, thinking more about that, we already have a separate executor for watchers, don't we?  So this may just be overthinking things.

    Correct, the queuing implementation where the waiting thread loops only helps waitForState().  Maybe we should just go with that for now and consider making CSW public as a follow up?  If we do make it public, I think we'd still want a separate executor, you don't want to end up blocking ZKSR's internal operations.

    Last push exposes CollectionStateWatcher directly again, and moves notification calls into an Executor.

    Yes, every watch firing event should run from a dedicated executor rather than using ZK's event thread. I have not dug in enough here to know it covers what you guys are talking about, but holding up a Watcher thread should no longer interfere with ZK clients internal event thread.

    On further reflection, I've pulled the separate executor back out again.  I think the SolrZkClient's separate executor will work well enough, and for the most part client code is going to be run inside a CloudSolrClient talking to the cluster, not a Solr node's internal state reader.  I've also removed the CSC.registerCollectionWatcher() method, as that's really only for internal use, leaving the waitForState() method as a convenience.
    
    I'd like to commit this in the next couple of days.  I think it will make a big difference to a bunch of test improvements I want to make separately.

    I did like the idea of a dedicated executor for collection events, just to ensure clean separation.  But I'll take a look in its current form.

    New plan!  We now have a separate notification thread, and change notifications are placed into a LinkedBlockingQueue that the thread waits on.
    
    A caveat: the queue is currently unbounded, which is a Bad Thing.  I'm not sure of the best way forward here - make it bounded, and just drop notifications if the queue is full?  Make a note on the collection predicate javadocs that all predicates run in a single thread, and users need to be careful not to run slow code in them?

    technical can _wait_ for non-existent collection.  Would like to know what happens if you try to watch for a non-existent one, does it get fired immediately, or only when the collection is created?

    I feel like this needs to check whether or not the collection exists / is a legacy collection.  If it's a legacy collection, you don't want to try to create a StateWatcher.

    Almost LGTM.  There's a few nits, but the only real issue is potentially setting up a StateWatcher on legacy.
    
    Nice work, I think we're almost done!!

    Ah, no, that's left over from the queue impl, will remove it.

    Ignore this, I'm dumb.  You want a state watcher either way (the old code did this).

                Still seeing test failures here, for example: http://jenkins.thetaphi.de/job/Lucene-Solr-6.x-Windows/181/consoleFull

It looks as though the collection watcher is being fired even though the state hasn't actually changed.  Will add some more debugging to try and work out why.
              </div></li><li><div>
                OK, I think I see what's happening.  

The test waits for a collection to be up, and then registers a watch to check for subsequent changes.  Once a wait has returned, then the watch is removed, but the collection isn't actually removed from the 'interesting' list until the next state update.

We have a race between state watchers being cleared after firing and the subsequent removal of a collection from the 'interesting' list, and the new watcher being added.  On a fast machine, the new watcher is added before the old one is cleared, and so the state is preserved between the calls; this means that the new watcher isn't actually fired, because we check if the state has changed before running notifications.  On a slower machine, the watcher is added afterwards, so there's no previous state to compare against, so the watcher is fired immediately - resulting in a test failure, because the test is expecting the state to have changed.

We can fix the test by calling registerCore() first, which puts the collection permanently on the watched list, but I think there's a bigger question here about how useful statewatchers are, as opposed to state predicate checks.  All the uses I've come up with so far have just been waitForState() calls.  [~dragonsinth] what do you think?
