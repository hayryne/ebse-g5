                </div><div><b>message:</b> MINOR: Reduce logging level for controller connection failures from `error` to `warn`

Before we switched from `BlockingChannel` to `NetworkClient`, we were
always reporting a successful connection due to the fact that
`BlockingChannel.connect` catches and swallows all exceptions. We
are now reporting failures (which is better), but `error` seems too
noisy (as can be seen in our tests).
