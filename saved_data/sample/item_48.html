                It doesn't look like this import is actually used in this file. Given how closely related `frame` and `frame_base` are, I wonder if they should just be combined?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Somewhat related: I wonder if there's some way to get a full accounting of pandas operations, so we can create functions that raise `NotImplementedError` for "everything else" and/or generate a to-do list for future work. Would it be reasonable to use `dir(pd.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy)` minus internal functions?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Pulled these out into constants. 

Yes, I think doing dir(cls) to both fill in NotImplemented methods and track current progress would be good to do (and we already have the correspondence with DeferredFrame._register_for). 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The idea here is that frame_base would contain the infrastructure, and frame would grow to include the concrete implementations of various operations (which would grow over time).
