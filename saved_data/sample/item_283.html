                This is an initial cut at a 64-bit linux port.

It runs, good enough, to surf through and the debug build did 1300 ops/sec against
2 cooked linux disks /dev/sdb,/dev/sdd for a couple minutes.

I am looking for a committer to help with code review, tracking down things I might
have missed and to discuss the approach to  atomics.  I am using the gnuc
builtin atomics __sync_XXXXX which gives portability to all GCC-based ports without
requiring the assembly language that was used before.


              </div></li><li><div>
                Paul Querna had also started porting atomics to use the gcc builtins, and we should compare those two.

One issue is that we need to support gcc compiler versions which do not support this. In particular, RHEL4 still uses gcc 3.x, and we unfortunately have to support this for the time being at least. Paul had suggested incorporating some stuff from APR, and use the builtins when possible, and APR otherwise. We should coordinate these two efforts.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Discussing with John for portability there is the HP research 'atomic_ops' project 

http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/

I haven't looked at it thoroughly but it supports quite a few platforms (X86, Itanium, Alpha, PA-RISC, PowerPC, and SPARC) and OSs (Linux, Microsoft Windows, HP/UX, Solaris, and MACOSX). They do indicate some ports are more complete than others. The license is mixture of MIT-style for code linked in with the client with some GPL stuff pulled into a separate library.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I left in the old code which will work for 32-bit machines using gcc 3.x, so the only folks who will be out will be
those who for some reason are running 64-bit but don't want to update their compiler.
I did break the makefile for the other platforms as I removed the .s file since I am not an automake guru.
Perhaps someone could tell me how to include that conditionally? (i.e. on __i386__ platforms)?  

The new c++0x standard will have atomic operations built in, and when that comes out we should
use that.  In the meantime, the GCC ones are also supported by Intel which covers another major
compiler.  The HP effort is a good idea for other platforms, as I have used it before and it is of good
quality.   Personally, I would just use the code below which is small, and passed the test_atomic regression
until the c++0x or someone wants another platform/compiler in which case I would go with the HP code.

Also, I am assuming sequential(esque) consistency which is true for i386, x86_64 and Sparc,
but should be conditioned for on other architectures like Power.

                The comment is wrong as the Itanium has a relaxed consistency model.  It should be x86 x86_64 Sparc.

                Fixed issue with ink_queue.  The freelists requires specialized code for each architecture to insert the version into the head pointer in unused bits.

This code now runs under high load for extended periods of time in forward proxy mode
with optimization turned on.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I am testing out the patch.  I have only one minor fix to the patch where one of our Makefile.am files hard codes -ltcl instead of using $(LIBTCL).  This broke the build on Fedora 11 core 64-bit.

There looks to be an incompatibility with the librecords files and I got a core when trying to read the "32-bit" librecords files.  I removed the old db files and let the 64-bit code recreate them.  We might want to look into this more or just tell people that the 32-bit and 64-bit files are incompatible.

I still need to test building the code as 32-bit and see if that didn't break.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> There is a problem with this patch on i386 (32-bit) platforms. When we use things like ink_atomic_cas64(long*, long, long);, gcc can't generate the atomic, and instead generates a symbol like

    __sync_bool_compare_and_swap_8


This causes the link phase to fail (obviously), since the symbol is undefined. Not sure what options we have, but possibly we'll have to #ifdef around the (new) code that now uses long (i.e. ink64) and the 64-bit versions of the atomic operations.

Also, I'm not sure what is more portable, but we already have code like

    #include &lt;limits.h&gt;

    #if ( __WORDSIZE == 64 )
    ...
    #endif


No matter what, I think we should standardize on one way to detect 64-bit, maybe in one of our include files we create another define, e.g.

#include &lt;limits.h&gt;
#if ( __WORDSIZE == 64 )
#define INK_64BIT_PLATFORM   1
#endif


or some such (and use that new define consistently throughout the code).

Thoughts?

                the problem with __syn_bool_XX is that those instructions are not supported on i386 and the x86_64 build didn't like -mpentium.

A solution is to add:

+AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(int *) # test for 64-bit pointers, this permits CFLAGS=-m32 for 32-bit compiles on 64-bit systems
+if test "${ac_cv_sizeof_int_p}" = "4"; then
+    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -march=pentium"
+    CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -march=pentium"
+else
+    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
+    CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS"
+fi

to configure.ac

The advantage of this is that it permits 32 bit compiles on native 64-bit systems by just doing 

configure CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32

v3 of the patch has this change and the corrected LIBTCL change.

I am still looking at librecord... which db was it that had to be deleted?  I don't remember this code, must
have been after my time.

    CXXFLAGS='-march=core2' ./confgure


As for the hostdb's etc, we added some stuff to make versioning of these things actually work (so, it'll self-destruct if it's an old version). Maybe also add something here for 64-bit vs 32-bit in the header?

                I meant to say, in my example case, the compiler gets invoked with

    -march=core2 -march=pentium


which one takes precedence here ? I'm assuming -march=pentium is the "minimum" architecture to get the appropriate builtins?
              </div></li><li><div>
                &gt;
&gt;     -march=core2 -march=pentium   

Humm... good point.  The original configure.ac just put -march=pentium in every time.  It also hard coded
the gnu c++ location to be /usr/bin/g++.  I have an updated version of gcc in /usr/local/bin that is ahead in my 
PATH which I think it should take so I changed this to be just g++.  Similarly, we should probably
check to see if an march is already specified and only if it is not add -march=pentium
for 32-bit builds (as this is the minium required to get the atomics to work).

That requires a substring search of CFLAGS which strains my autoconf/bash abilities.
Any suggestions would be welcome.

I'm looking into this to see if I can just make them compatible.  If not, then a flag in the header.

                This might fix the HostDB problem.  The HostDBInfo struct wasn't padded to a multiple of 8 bytes.

                One option would be to have a --with-architecture or some such as a switch in configure. E.g.

AC_ARG_WITH(architecture, [AC_HELP_STRING([--with-architecture=&lt;arch&gt;], [explicitly specify the architecture to use with various compilers])], ac_architecture=$withval)

(not sure the above works, but something like that).

And then use $ac_architecture if specified with the gcc compiler switches, and if not, default to some other "heuristics" like we did before (we'll want to support other -march= values for other platforms later on I'm sure).

This would allow me to configure TS with something like

    --with-architecture=core2

and be all set :).

Thoughts?

              </div></li><li><div>
                Attached is a patch that provides:

1) --with-architecture=&lt;arch&gt;, which can be used to explicitly set the architecture for -march with configure

2) Make sure that CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS don't append a -march=pentium if there already is a value for -march= in there.


#1 provides a convenience feature, and #2 should make this more compatible with typical usage of configure (as above).

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> John,

For the 'ts-64bit-v3.patch': adjust the $CFLAGS and $CXXFLAGS in your 'ac_cv_sizeof_int_p' test block so that the flags are appended to the string instead of prefixing the string.

In this way, you will then be able to let the package builder override the architecture values like so:

./configure CFLAGS=-march=core2 CXXFLAGS=-march=core2

The g++ commands will come out a little redundant:
g++ -DPACKAGE_NAME=... -march=pentium -march=core2 ...

But g++ will honor the last param passed of the same type so core2 ends up taking effect over i386.

Cheers,
Andrew

                Andrew,

Leif's patch deals with this by not adding the -march=pentium if there is already an -march supplied.

                To make tracking of the patchset easier I have a git server:

If you add this as an additional remote you can keep in sync with both the x86_64 patchset
and the current trunk (if I fall behind) using git-merge.

I will try not to let it fall too far behind the trunk.

1) Can we restore the -g for the release build? -ggdb3 is extremely verbose, making all the binaries 3x as large.

2) If we're no incorporating the patches I did for -march= detection, I think we need to do what Andrew suggested, and change the order in configure.ac, e.g.

    CCFLAGS="-march=pentium $CCFLAGS"
    CXXFLAGS="-march=pentium $CXXFLAGS"

3) Finally, I did a test with -march=i486 with the v4 patch, and it does not work. So -march=pentium is a minimum. I think we should change this to -march=i586 though, it's more in-line with the naming conventions used by the distros.

I'm doing a second review of the actual code changes too, hopefully we can land this soon.
