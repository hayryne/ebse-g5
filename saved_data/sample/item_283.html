                </div><div><b>body:</b> After the self-nomination process we still had a few gaps.  I've reviewed past commit history to suggest a couple names for each remaining area.

As per dev list discussion, review period for this PR will be extended to 3pm Friday Jan 8.  At that time, anyone that has not explicitly consented to their nomination (by approving this PR) will be removed (and if this leaves any code areas with fewer than 2 owners, the remaining owner will be cleared as well).

                Not sure if I'm the best person to be a codeowner for code that I haven't looked at in the longest time. @upthewaterspout or @galen-pivotal would be MUCH better alternatives for this.

                I can certainly try to help whenever/however I can with reviewing `PRs` but, truth be told, I'm not working that much on Geode code nowadays and wouldn't be fair to leave all the work to @gesterzhou alone.

                Unfortunately @luissson is not a Geode committer so cannot be a code owner.

                On the compression I suggest changing sabbey37 to kirklund

                On the entry and map code I suggest changing sabbey37 to Bruce or Dan
