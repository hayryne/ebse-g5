                Can it just send a 307 "resubmit same verb" response to the caller? That will be picked up by browsers and handled as a new GET, while REST clients (including curl, jersey, htttpclient) will either GET or resubmit the original verb depending on their config.

Sending a custom structured response won't work with those existing clients
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~adhoot] Feel free to assign back to yourself, if you have already worked on this ticket.

[~steve_l] Please take a look.

Removed the refresh header,  add the location header to hold the redirect url, and set status as 307.

This is standby RM. The redirect url ishttp://localhost:23188/ws/v1/cluster/metrics
{code}

If i do
{code}
$ curl -i -L http://127.0.0.1:33188/ws/v1/cluster/metrics
{code}
, it will redirect to the active rm and get the metrics.

                Hello [~xgong]

I noticed that you set an Ignore tag for testRMWebAppRedirect in your patch, can you please let me know why to ignore this test case ? Any idea that how to fix this ? I opened another JIRA YARN-3601, please let me know if that one is valid.
