                Just discussed the progress of this ticket with [~joewitt]. Based off that discussion, we are going to remove support for registration. By supporting registration, we would be introducing new concerns for managing user profiles, password change policies, password resets, storage, etc. These policies should be driven by an organization and not managed in or through NiFi. Instead, we are going to focus on adding more support for authentication options based on username/password.
