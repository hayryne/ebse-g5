                Docs Changes
* All references to {{SharedPtr}} need to be replaced with [{{std::shared_ptr}}|http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr] (suggest using this link too)
* All {{\*Ptr}} typedefs replaced with explicit {{std::shared_ptr&lt;\*&gt;}}. For example, {{CacheableStringPtr}} is now {{std::shared_ptr&lt;CacheableString&gt;}}. (not complete)
