                </div><div><b>description:</b> Rat is griping about the missing license headers in a few of the source files, so these need to be added.&nbsp; It's also complaining about a few config files which do NOT need license headers, so these need to be added to .ratignore.&nbsp; We also saw some leftover stuff in a cmake-build-debug folder, so we need to make sure the directory is git cleaned before the release manager runs cpack.&nbsp; Lastly, one file was mysteriously absent from the documentation in the final package, so we need to verify that this was spurious or get the file properly added.

GEODE-6139: Enforce Apache Rat findings in Travis CI (#414)

* GEODE-6139: Fix problems reported by rat in source release
- Add missing license headers to a couple of files
- Fix bad line for '.vs' in .gitignore
- Tell rat to ignore some trivial config files
- Remove stray tmp file
- Fix cmake file that was badly reformatted
- Fix .cpackignore string.  .gitignore files use globbing, not regex, so they can't be read into cpack ignore directly
- Run a script to execute rat and parse the result, rather than execute directly from Travis, so we can fail the build if rat reports issues
