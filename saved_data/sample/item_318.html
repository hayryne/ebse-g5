Before creating a pull request, please file an issue in the ASF Jira system for Lucene or Solr:

* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LUCENE
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR

You will need to create an account in Jira in order to create an issue.

The title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:

* LUCENE-####: &lt;short description of problem or changes&gt;
* SOLR-####: &lt;short description of problem or changes&gt;

LUCENE and SOLR must be fully capitalized. A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.

Properly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. --&gt;
