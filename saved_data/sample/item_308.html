                </div><div><b>body:</b> Currently when user edits datasource name of the **Edit Dataset** modal on Chart Explore, it looks like this change is saved globally for all charts / the original datasource gets renamed. 

When user edits chart using Change Dataset option on Chart Explore, it only changes dataset locally for the chart.

### Expected results

Is this behavior expected? Changing the dataset globally for all charts / actually renaming a dataset (which impacts all charts using this dataset) seems problematic to do on chart explore, when a user who doesn't own the other charts can do this. It is really not clear to the user that it will change for all charts - especially because in the past, this only changed locally for the chart. 

### Actual results

Renames dataset, so it's easy to break all charts! 

#### Screenshots
I had two different chars using same dataset (broken). Wanted to change this for one of the charts. It got changed for both charts. (In this case it sounds great, but in most cases, it will unexpectedly break charts of other people).

Two different charts:

#### How to reproduce the bug

1. Go to Chart Explore
2. Click on Edit dataset and change dataset
3. See that all charts using the old dataset changed to new dataset

### Environment

(please complete the following information):

                </div><div><b>body:</b> Currently when user edits datasource name of the **Edit Dataset** modal on Chart Explore, it looks like this change is saved globally for all charts / the original datasource gets renamed. 

When user edits chart using Change Dataset option on Chart Explore, it only changes dataset locally for the chart.

### Expected results

Is this behavior expected? Changing the dataset globally for all charts / actually renaming a dataset (which impacts all charts using this dataset) seems problematic to do on chart explore, when a user who doesn't own the other charts can do this. It is really not clear to the user that it will change for all charts - especially because in the past, this only changed locally for the chart. 

### Actual results

Renames dataset, so it's easy to break all charts! 

#### Screenshots
I had two different chars using same dataset (broken). Wanted to change this for one of the charts. It got changed for both charts. (In this case it sounds great, but in most cases, it will unexpectedly break charts of other people).

#### How to reproduce the bug

1. Go to Chart Explore
2. Click on Edit dataset and change dataset
3. See that all charts using the old dataset changed to new dataset

When user edits chart using Change Dataset option on Chart Explore, it only changes dataset locally for the chart.

### Expected results

Is this behavior expected? Changing the dataset globally for all charts / actually renaming a dataset (which impacts all charts using this dataset) seems problematic to do on chart explore, when a user who doesn't own the other charts can do this. It is really not clear to the user that it will change for all charts - especially because in the past, this only changed locally for the chart. 

### Actual results

Renames dataset, so it's easy to break all charts!

Changing the dataset globally for all charts / actually renaming a dataset (which impacts all charts using this dataset) seems problematic to do on chart explore, when a user who doesn't own the other charts can do this. It is really not clear to the user that it will change for all charts - especially because in the past, this only changed locally for the chart. 

### Actual results

Renames dataset, so it's easy to break all charts! 

#### Screenshots
I had two different chars using same dataset (broken). Wanted to change this for one of the charts. It got changed for both charts. (In this case it sounds great, but in most cases, it will unexpectedly break charts of other people).

Two different charts:

#### How to reproduce the bug

1. Go to Chart Explore
2. Click on Edit dataset and change dataset
3. See that all charts using the old dataset changed to new dataset

                </div><div><b>body:</b> Currently when user edits datasource name of the **Edit Dataset** modal on Chart Explore, it looks like this change is saved globally for all charts / the original datasource gets renamed. 

When user edits chart using Change Dataset option on Chart Explore, it only changes dataset locally for the chart.

### Expected results

Is this behavior expected? Changing the dataset globally for all charts / actually renaming a dataset (which impacts all charts using this dataset) seems problematic to do on chart explore, when a user who doesn't own the other charts can do this. It is really not clear to the user that it will change for all charts - especially because in the past, this only changed locally for the chart. 

### Actual results

Renames dataset, so it's easy to break all charts! 

#### Screenshots
I had two different chars using same dataset (broken). Wanted to change this for one of the charts. It got changed for both charts. (In this case it sounds great, but in most cases, it will unexpectedly break charts of other people).

Two different charts:

                Opened this as a potential BUG / DISCUSSION point. If this really is intended behavior - it is quite problematic if you have many users, and we might need to look into some other options how to prevent users from breaking other people's charts.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> problematic indeed... I am seeing the same errors. 😢 @lilykuang please prioritize it. 
When user changes dataset of one chart in Explore, it should only affect the local chart. Also, i agree that being able to change a dataset in **Edit Dataset** modal seems to be a confusing/unnecessary feature while user can actually complete the task by going to **Change Dataset**.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Wait. This is totally the expected behavior, it's the "Dataset Editor" and there's not one but two alert/warnings clarifying this. Duplicating datasets so that each chart would have its own makes no sense to me, you'd have to define the configuraiton / metrics / calculated dimensions for each chart and wouldn't be able to reuse the work done there.

One thing that could help would be to actually list out the list of charts (and perhaps associated owners) that will be affected.

                We actually have an endpoint that responds with how many objects a dataset is connected to, used on the datasets page. 

I think the question here is really, should we remove this modal from the explore page and instead redirect to the datasets page? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I agree @nytai, allowing user to configure the underlying dataset while user is working on a specific chart in Explore does not make sense to me. This action should happens in **Datasets**. we should either remove this change dataset feature in **Edit Dataset**, or remove this modal from explore page entirely. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                This shortcut is super useful, you can add new metrics and calculated dimensions without loosing context. @eugeniamz can chime in as a power user.
              </div></li><li><div>
                We should have a clear definition of each module(Data, Explore, Dashboard, SQL lab)'s primary purposes. Shortcuts are great, but they don't necessarily live on the same page. as long as we have clear redirection between modules, then user should be able to stay in the context without getting confused. 

The problem i have been seeing in Superset is that user have multiple entry points to complete one task, in some cases, it is convenient, but most of time users get confused. I strongly suggest to remove this modal from Explore, and create a better flow between Datasets and Explore. @mistercrunch 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I strongly suggest that we keep this modal until we create a better flow between Datasets and Explore
              </div></li><li><div>
                sounds good, that's a well defined problem to solve - create a better flow between Datasets and Explore  
              </div></li><li><div>
                In the meantime, we know for sure that regardless of the point of entry (explore or dataset), listing the affected charts on save bellow that alert/warning would be helpful and hard really really hard to disregard/misunderstand. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                that's helpful. what about dataset changes affecting other people's charts? setting permission maybe? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Things that can break charts:
- pointing to another table or schema
- changing or deleting a metric definition
- changing or deleting a calculated dimension
- altering the SQL
- changing settings (this shouldn't break a chart)
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> For clarity, this task is not yet actionable. @lilykuang please do not work on this until we achieve clarity.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                We think that the editing metric, calculated columns, etc. isn't THAT problematic. Once in a while, someone deletes some metric and someone else's charts break, but this is really rare. What we think is problematic is specifically the change dataset - the 1st tab - the fact that you can **change the table that backs a dataset**. And this changes for everyone. For physical datasets this is a very rare scenario, that a physical table gets actually renamed, and it shouldn't be so easy for user to do this change. In terms of virtual dataset - no problem, they are rarely shared among users (or at most shared within a single team). In the past this might have been the existing behavior, but it was in the last tab on that modal, so it wasn't so obvious. 


&gt; One thing that could help would be to actually list out the list of charts (and perhaps associated owners) that will be affected.

                Sounds like there is a small action item / task here is to surface the impact of the potential changes that could be as simple as # of charts associated with the change &amp; probably the link to the crud view with the search query.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Recently, I have spent a lot of time in this very area, and my opinion is that 1) it is indeed a potentially unintuitive experience, however, 2) it is consistent as is, and after a bit of a learning curve for the user it gets the job done. The warnings are in place to make the user aware of the potential impact. Any change to the current behavior would be arbitrary, and just as confusing for users who seek the opposite type of behavior, so it would only shift the problem, and not solve it. I'd like to do proper user research to discover the overall user flow and make structural changes informed by that.

                I agree that the behavior is consistent across the entire modal - and there should be a consistency. 

We are just trying to surface that is is an issue for larger organizations. It is not a problem if you are the only person who owns charts using specific datasource, or if you don't have production dashboards shared across. As soon as you deploy Superset for a larger group of people where they share the underlying datasets this becomes a problem - one user making change not knowing that it might impact all other charts and other people's charts break (user is used to the calculated columns and metrics, but not to the first tab when currently they think it just changes for the specific chart). Users broke charts 2x since this was moved from last tab to 1st tab of that modal (and there might have been more cases not reported).

                Based on our discussion in meetup, we had a few ideas:
- show all charts that used this dataset
- `Source` tab: by default is `read-only` (view mode). We will show a button or link say "Edit Dataset" to enable the Edit mode, then user can switch dataset for all the charts that used current dataset.

Could we implement above ideas?

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> At the meetup, we clarified that:
- landing on `Source` tab is confusing, since the user is likely to want to edit metrics or calculated dimensions
- `Source` tab is "most descriptive" of the dataset, what it is and where it's pointing to
- spoke about maybe point to a different default Tab selected (say metrics)
- Disabling the content of `Source` tab, showing may a lock icon that can be unlocked with an appropriate message
- Eventually (more complicated, probably phase 2, if ever), we could categorize destructive and non-destructive changes and act accordingly. Say adding a metric could not show any warnings, but deleting one would show you warning. Pushing this idea we could even try to see if/which chart is using that metric.

In any case, it's pretty clear that showing the list of associated charts that will/may be affected by the change seems like a positive thing.

Based on @mistercrunch summary above:

&gt; landing on Source tab is confusing, since the user is likely to want to edit metrics or calculated dimensions
&gt; Source tab is "most descriptive" of the dataset, what it is and where it's pointing to
&gt; spoke about maybe point to a different default Tab selected (say metrics)

.. can we agree to move Source tab before (or after) settings right now?

              </div></li><li><div>
                @zuzana-vej this is a bit tricky situation. Until recently when the current UI was implemented, we had two disparate experienced to edit the dataset, depending on where the user came from. Now we have a single experience that can be accessed from both entry points. I am not sure if we know for a fact that when the user clicks on "Edit Dataset" their intent is *always* to edit the dataset for that single chart. I think different personas would have different intents. I also think that any changes to the user flow (i.e. moving tabs around) would be arbitrary. My suggestion is to focus on making sure that the user makes a fully informed decision when they edit the dataset. This means purposefully creating friction in the flow so that we focus their attention to the impact. What I propose is that I will work with our Designers to come up with different variations for changes and then post them here for everyone to review. Will that work?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Generally we don't want user to make the edits here. But I agree that this could differ across all users using Superset across many organizations (likely the smaller want to enable this, while the larger might want to disable this). I understand we need to have solution that works for everyone not just the larger groups. So I think

&gt; purposefully creating friction in the flow so that we focus their attention to the impact.

will work.

While we might not be able to do the best case scenario right away (e.g. categorizing potentially destructive / non destructive scenarios), we would like to make some simple change soon so that we eliminate the impact. Either disabling it (temporarily), moving the tab (temporarily) or adding the lock (disabled) which can be unlocked after acknowledging warning. If you can keep us posted we can probably make the first small change right away (within a week or two).

                Hi @zuzana-vej

                Thanks @benceorlai  for sharing the proposed designs! I assume these will be used for both editing dataset, as well as in future, for when user is editing metrics, or calculated columns (which still impacts all datasets).

In the meanwhile, @graceguo-supercat has a solution aligned to the discussion from the meetup and some of above notes, specifically only for the data source tab:
_when user open source tab, by default all the table/schema name should be read-only, there will be a padlock, click it to enter edit mode_ 

The solution are complementary.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi @benceorlai i feel the dataset edit flow will look like this:
- when user open Source tab, by default all the table/schema name should be read-only
- there will be a padlock, click it to enter edit mode
- When user start to edit, your proposal with warning and number of charts shared message will make more sense. 

Otherwise, whenever user open dataset editor, even they just want to read dataset info, or change metrics or columns, they will always see huge warnings, and sending extra API to get number of charts using this dataset (unnecessary cost).

                hey @graceguo-supercat and @zuzana-vej do you have an illustration of your proposed solution? (I will be glad to create wireframes!) i have the following questions:
- There are two entry points to editing a Dataset: 1) from the top menu Data &gt; Datasets 2) from Explore &gt; Edit datset. Would the proposed "locking mechanism" apply to both experiences?
- Editing the table/schema and the fields/metrics is the same user flow: editing the dataset. Based on your description it seems you are thinking of it as two different experiences. Would the locking mechanism apply to both?
- what would be required from the user to unlock the read-only mode?
- I assume that every time the users opens a Dataset for editing, the lock will be in place. I think for users who edit datasets regularly, they may find it annoying to have to unlock the dataset each time? have you considered that side effect?

let me know if you want me to create wireframes, i will be glad to do so
              </div></li><li><div>
                1) Yes the proposed "locking mechanism" apply to both entry points.
2) yes, i prefer to have extra protection for editing `Source`(with table/schema). So only `Source` tab have read-only mode and padlock.
3) currently datasource owners do not have extra permission. we (airbnb team) are thinking about adding additional constraints, for example only `admin` role can change schema or table, but no solid decision by now.
4) Once the dataset is created and charts are built on top of it, in our past experience, the need to change metric/columns, is a lot more than the need to change schema/table. 

If you feel this read-only layer is reasonable, could you please create a wireframes for this case? I can implement the function pretty soon. 
But for edit mode, which has extra warning and new API call, it is not high pri issue for airbnb at this moment, so maybe we could it later?

              </div></li><li><div>
                @zuzana-vej and @graceguo-supercat 

i have consulted our UX designers on this. they will design a better experience and will create specs with ease of implementation in mind. give us a couple of days to create the design specs!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Posting 2 options here. Both general ideas were discussed in this thread. I think option 1 makes most sense and does a better job at addressing the user problem here by providing 2 paths. (1) edit original and make global changes and (2) copy dataset and edit dataset per exploration/chart. Option 2 shows the padlock idea which to me adds unnecessary friction. The problem is that users are accidentally editing the dataset w/o knowing it makes a global change not that the fields are too easy to access and edit. I think if there were some credentials to input (based on certain permissions) after unlocking padlock then the flow could be more effective. 

other general changes:
• warning message/copy was tweaked to be more clear, concise and useful 
• styling changed to increase visual emphasis 
• warning messages are intentionally disruptive to the flow 


![Option 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60786102/100024353-702b5180-2d9b-11eb-953a-a39570ebf800.jpg)

                **_Copy dataset_** function is not available right now, and it is not an idea we discussed in this thread.
I think right now, we should focus on the agreement made in Superset meetup. Please see @mistercrunch summery here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11478#issuecomment-720125272

              </div></li><li><div>
                With option 2, I don't think the "copy dataset" should not be default. 

How exactly will the "copy dataset" behave? 
The dataset for virtual datasource --&gt; create different virtual datasource (easy) 
But how about dataset which is a physical table? Each physical table should exist only once, it's a pointer / reference to a table in database which shares same name. If user wants to "copy" dataset to change the name of dataset used for the chart - what do they actually want to do? Do they just want to change it for the specific chart?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Correct. Copy dataset is not an idea discussed in this thread but is an idea we discussed at Preset and wanted to share here as something to think about. In re. to changing tab order we think that "Source" qualifies the table most and we should therefore consider positioning it first/keeping as is (@mistercrunch). 

The main goal in these designs is to be more clear in the messaging so that users can make informed decisions.


Option 3 (sim to opt 1 but w/o copy dataset functionality). 

![Option 3 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60786102/100036044-429ed200-2db4-11eb-92e1-02c93b6b4755.jpg)
              </div></li><li><div>
                We aren't planning to change the source tab order. As a first step, @graceguo-supercat  has a draft PR to have the lock and warning message (without number of impacted charts - that can be enhancement). 

One thing for option 3 (listing all the charts) which might not work in all cases is if the number of charts is large. For some popular datasets there could be tens of hundreds of charts potentially. So having a count and option to click on that looks best. Additionally it could be good to highlight if those impacted charts are owned by other people, and having the message as "... 5 other charts using this dataset, owned by 2 other owners" or just generically "... 5 other charts using this dataset, some of which are owned by another owner." I think that could really add some importance to the message. If I am the only owner I might go ahead with the change but otherwise I might think twice. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                About option 1, I don't think it's a common need or flow we want to steer towards, plus I think currently it's not allowed to have 2 datasets pointing to the same table (though maybe it should be allowed, but that's another topic). Forking the dataset is not really desirable. Keep in mind that most changes (add a metric or add a calculated dimension) should not be breaking as well.

Option 3 seems alright, and originally was thinking it could show a small table of "name, owners", though now we're a bit in overthinking-it territory.

For the rare case where there are dozens/hundreds of charts, I think scrollbar is ok.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think PR #11781 is a very good stepping stone to start solving this problem. What Stephen proposed are options to go further with the solution.

The core problem in my opinion is that: the user in Explore wants to modify the dataset to fit their needs for a modified or new visualization. I think the intent can be one of two intents: make permanent changes to the Dataset OR make some ad-hoc changes to test a new visualization. Making the edits harder does not seem to solve the actual user need, it just makes it harder to achieve. The actual solution can include the option to do a "Save as" on the dataset, because that allows the user to make the breaking changes, get the dataset they want AND avoid impacting other users.

Hence our proposal for a duplicate dataset flow (Option 1): "Do you need to test some ad hoc changes in the Dataset?" - "Do it on a personal copy, without the risk of affecting others"

I don't think our proposal is mutually exclusive with Grace's PR #11781, rather it further extends on it, while offers a viable non-breaking alternative flow.

I am aware this solution needs more work and we will be glad to consider it for our roadmap if engineering resources are a concern.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> #11781 solves our immediate need and that's something we feel comfortable with, and I agree they are not exclusive, it's step in the right direction either way. We don't plan at this point to work on the next steps - but I am glad we were aligned this first step is in the right direction for everyone.

I get your point about user intents, and I think we should be very careful if we allow duplicating datasets, even though I see the point - that could be OK for small user base, but with 2500 WAUs and hundreds of data sets, this will cause clutter - many duplicate datasets, resulting in any migrations being possibly much harder, possibly scaling issues, users getting confused if each of their charts uses different dataset they duplicated earlier and forgot, and more. So would love to be part future discussions on this topic if this is to be considered.

                Thanks Zuzana, indeed, #11781 is the quick solution.

there is an interesting side-convo about this here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11781#issuecomment-733186632, seems like having a View, Edit (and potentially a Duplicate) action would very well disambiguate the UX for the different intents? @Steejay thoughts?

As for adding a Duplicate option, it has much more implications that we need to carefully think of:

1. Should we still show the "Changes apply to all charts using this dataset" warning when a datasource is newly duplicated?
2. Should we allow the duplication of physical datasource?
3. How will this play out for organizations that want a shared set of metrics and columns for the same dataset?

                `Copy dataset` is a new idea that not in Superset before. I think it worth a discussion in meetup or SIP. Here is just some of my questions:

- what is major problem that copy dataset want to resolve, while all current solutions can not? what use case need `copy dataset`?
- what dataset can be copied?
- what is result of coping a dataset? 
- After the dataset being copied, is there any change to the original dataset? how about charts that used original dataset?
- When a dataset has multiple copies, is there anyway to make them sync? otherwise, with so many copies of the similar data, which copy is single version of truth? How do other users and teams to share dataset?
- In what context we should offer `copy dataset` option? Does `copy dataset` have to be in Explore view?

                I think the padlock should apply only when the user enters the Dataset edit screen from Explore. When the enter through Data &gt;Datasets&gt;Edit, the padlock should not apply. In the latter case, the user's intent is clear, to edit the dataset, and the padlock can get annoying quickly.

Hi @benceorlai thanks for the feedback, but i could not agree with this point. When a dataset is large and shared by multiple users/teams, many time you want to _**check and make sure**_ the definition of its metrics and calculated columns before actually make chart out of it.

In the explore view context, i would believe the majority of use cases for Datasets &gt; Edit, is to see dataset details instead of actual change it.

That's an interesting point you raise, and then the solution could be the introduction of a new "View" action, in addition to "Edit". My approach to this is to align the user intent and the UX, and I think the "Edit" term is very unambiguous to know what the user should expect. It seems that View (=see details), Edit (=make global changes) and Copy (=make 1-off changes) options would cover every possible intent.

                @benceorlai i think the idea of _viewing_ the dataset properties has merits but doesn't necessarily need to be a part of the modal experience itself. if the majority of the use cases are to "see dataset details instead of actually changing it" or (similarly) "check and make sure" the properties are right, there could be an opportunity to expose this info in the side panel _before_ entering the "Edit Dataset" flow. Sim to what we have here but make this view more accessible:

                here is a real example: a calculated column `Capped duration`:

When a dataset has a lot of calculated columns and metrics, users have to visit this pretty often to make sure the definition.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I agree with **edit** vs. **view** in future. In ideal case though, you don't have to go to the modal to view calculated metric's / column's definition. You can hover over it in the new left side bar and see the definition / calculation - the SQL expression basically. For now, I think the current solution is OK, and it's better to be on a safer side.

Not sure if everyone knows this, but you can hover on the little help icon after a pre-defined metric/calculated column to see its definition:

                I'm not sure how to do it, but should we place the padlock near the input fields? I'm worried users wouldn't know it's clickable. It would also be nice to have some tooltip or explanatory text on why it is locked.

Or, we can place a "Unlock Edit" link in the warning alert (potentially restyle it to make it more visible).

                @ktmud thinking we could position the padlock here w the supporting copy.

                @Steejay You design looks good!

Here's another alternative:

&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/100269370-45600b00-2f0b-11eb-8820-70f98f578f24.png" width="600"&gt;

              </div></li><li><div>
                that could work too @ktmud! i think it would be nice to keep all action buttons in the same region though. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                We need extra protection here because current change in Source Tab is confusing. **_It looks like to build a chart from different dataset, but actually it is to change the tables used by that dataset_**. If i created a dataset and share this dataset with others, I would allow other ppl add metrics or columns, but I would not want someone change the tables for my dataset. If needed you should create (or copy) your own dataset.

Edit metrics and columns is different: it won't change the tables that defines this dataset. When user edit Metrics or Columns, they can find error and recover it right away. (Remove existed metrics and columns are dangerous too, you might remove something other ppl use). Edit Metrics and Calculated Columns also happens pretty often, so we don't want to add extra click for this operation.

@ktmud and @Steejay Your design looks good, but please note only `Source` tab has ReadOnly control. Both header and footer section, are shared with other tabs. We can do hide and show for Padlock if user is in other tab, but I just want to emphasis **"Source" tab** need extra careful protection.

              </div></li><li><div>
                The warning text applies to other tabs so I think it makes sense to apply the lock to other tabs, too. As you have noted, deleting a metric/column is also dangerous.
              </div></li><li><div>
                good reference: Mac (System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy) has a sim padlock experience. Some tabs allow editing some dont unless padlock is unlocked. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The extra feature flag `DISABLE_DATASET_SOURCE_EDIT`, only meant to disable other user change dataset, but allow different teams to enrich dataset. Additional Padlock will make add/modify metric and columns more troublesome, which happens very often in airbnb. 

@ktmud and @Steejay I think for this PR we should focus on implementing the options raised and discussed on last meetup: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11478#issuecomment-720125272
If you have more options, bring up to meetup (or SIP) and get feedback from more audience.

                Added additional description for the `padlock`:

Note: i still prefer to keep padlock inside `Source` tab and not in the shared area with other tabs, just to make `Source` tab a little special.

                i'd recommend adhering to the alignment set by the original context to reduce visual clutter. Suggesting we move the lock to the bottom (but still inside the Source tab) so we dont break up the content of the form by having the padlock in the middle. Attached a mock for reference.

Curious to see how does this look in the virtual datasource tab though? There's a very tall code editor that takes a lot of space.

it is disabled, you can't edit text in SQL Editor. But you can't tell from screenshot. this component is set to disabled, but its UI is controlled by `react-ace` component.

By the way, i feel the padlock icon, it's hard to see `locked` or `unlocked`.

                for the previous comments:
1) I shorten the Editor height from 24 lines =&gt; 20 lines. I don't want to make this really small because in airbnb many virtual dataset are huge...
2) I added grey background for the readOnly mode for Editor. please see the updated UI in description.

IMO every feature flag should be false by default, similar to every A/B testing experience starts with a current base (new feature being disabled) vs a new feature. We set the default of a feature flag to `true` only when we put an A/B testing full-on, but they will be cleaned up eventually.

                I think this should be updated to `DISABLE_DATASET_SOURCE_EDIT` as well.

Why did the test pass even when the feature flag is not correct?
              </div></li><li><div>
                fixed. The logic here is **_if feature is not enabled_**, though used the wrong feature name, this feature "disable edit", is not enabled.
