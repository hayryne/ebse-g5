 * Examples of using {@link ParametricVectorGenerator} for generating two dimensional data.
 * {@link ParametricVectorGenerator} allows to create surfaces in N-dinensional spaces where each
 * dimension depends on one parameter 't'. In such generator just one random producer is used, it
 * defines a set of values for parameter 't'.
