                I'll try to solve this issue. :)
              </div></li><li><div>
                By the way, How to change "Assignee" to me?&nbsp;

[~huxing] and me can't find the way neither.&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                That is probably due to the way permissions are configured for this Jira project.

Given the consensus appears to be to move to github issues, is this something that needs fixing? A comment along the lines of "Looking at this now" should suffice.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm not an admin (even though I requested to be) so I can't currently give you permission sorry.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I've requested Jira to grant me admin permission. My concern is the GSOC tasks. Someone of us should be able to change assignee if a student shows interest.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Yep, we will use Github issues as IssueManagement, so it's ok.&nbsp;Thanks also.

I have another 2 questions:
 # Is it necessary to&nbsp;change the pom.xml parent to org.apache:apache:19 ? Now we use sonatype oss as the central&nbsp;repository.
 # Is it necessary to&nbsp;change all the java package name to org.apache.* ? If do this, users will encounter the upgrading problem.

Thanks again.&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Also about the groupId, does it need to change to "org.apache" or "org.apache.dubbo" ?

                Hi Yong,

Good news! Infra has added me and Justin as Admin.

And I have added&nbsp;you as developer. You should be able to change assignee now.

Please try again and let me know if it does not work.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~huxing], it seems that the problem is still there : (
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Yong,

I have added you to as contributor, and I am able to find you when changing assignee.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Great job. I can change assignee too.
              </div></li><li><div>

                Update manifestEntries. It is recommended that the standard Apache settings are used.

&nbsp;

About this point, we could&nbsp;refer here[1]. Pay more attention, if we are in podling status, we must include a disclaimer.

                The LICENSE and NOTICE looks like it could do with a little more work, the NOTICE&nbsp;file in particular as&nbsp;licenses of dependancies shouldn't be mentioned there - see&nbsp;http://www.apache.org/dev/licensing-howto.html

                [~Jerrick Zhu] Could you please check do we still have anything to do here?
I noticed that the groupID and package name has been changed.

                * Update manifestEntries. It is recommended that the standard Apache settings are used

I have check this issue in master(2.7.x), it looks good to me(LICENSE and NOTICE and DISCLAIMER are in the bin/source zip)
 * Consider specifying a maven coordination relocation&nbsp;

Since 2.7.x has rename groupId to org.apache.dubbo, is it&nbsp;mandatory to do this relocation? If so, does someone can provider any guides for us?&nbsp;

                &gt; Since 2.7.x has rename groupId to org.apache.dubbo, is it mandatory to do this relocation? If so, does someone can provider any guides for us? 

I don't think there is something we need to do here. User has to change it maven coordination manually when upgrading.

I think we can close this issue now.
