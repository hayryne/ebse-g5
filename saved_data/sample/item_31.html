 * An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of
 * pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 64-bit seed, which is
 * modified using a linear congruential formula.

   * Random64 is a pseudorandom algorithm(LCG). Therefore, we will get same sequence
   * if seeds are the same. This main will test how many calls nextLong() it will
   * get the same seed.
   *
   * We do not need to save all numbers (that is too large). We could save
   * once every 100000 calls nextLong(). If it get a same seed, we can
   * detect this by calling nextLong() 100000 times continuously.
   *
   
              </div></li><li><div>
                 We regard seed as unsigned long, therefore used '&gt;&gt;&gt;' instead of '&gt;&gt;'.

                 Use Random64 to avoid issue described in HBASE-21256.

 &nbsp;
 1. Generator is too slow at the generating stage, the root cause is SecureRandom. There is a global lock in&nbsp;SecureRandom(&nbsp;See the following picture). I use Random instead of SecureRandom, and it could speed up this stage(500% up with 20 mapper). &nbsp;SecureRandom was brought&nbsp;by&nbsp;HBASE-13382, but speaking of generating random bytes, in my opnion,
 it is the same with Random.

!ITBLL-1.png!

2. VerifyReducer have a cpu cost of 14% on format method. This is cause by create keyString variable. However, keyString may never be used if test result is correct.(and that's in most cases). Just delay creating keyString can yield huge performance boost in verifing stage.

!ITBLL-2.png!

3.Arguments check is needed, because there's&nbsp;constraint between arguments. If we broken this constraint, we can not get a correct circular list.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;
 4.Let&nbsp;big family value size could be configured.

 &nbsp;
 1. Generator is too slow at the generating stage, the root cause is SecureRandom. There is a global lock in&nbsp;SecureRandom(&nbsp;See the following picture). I use Random instead of SecureRandom, and it could speed up this stage(500% up with 20 mapper). &nbsp;SecureRandom was brought&nbsp;by&nbsp;HBASE-13382, but speaking of generating random bytes, in my opnion,
 it is the same with Random.

2. VerifyReducer have a cpu cost of 14% on format method. This is cause by create keyString variable. However, keyString may never be used if test result is correct.(and that's in most cases). Just delay creating keyString can yield huge performance boost in verifing stage.

!ITBLL-2.png!

3.Arguments check is needed, because there's&nbsp;constraint between arguments. If we broken this constraint, we can not get a correct circular list.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;
 4.Let&nbsp;big family value size could be configured.

                Thanks for working on this.

On SecureRandom, what about the original argument that Random is more likely to have a collision? A collision could cause the test to fail?

#2 sounds like a nice saving.

The other items sound great too.

Thanks

Since you added precondition checks in your patch, can you add one for the above against the value of hbase.client.keyvalue.maxsize ?

Thanks for review.&nbsp;[~stack]&nbsp; [~Apache9]&nbsp;[~yuzhihong@gmail.com]

I don't agree with that. This kind of collision ONLY depends on how long the key(128-bits) is.
It is 48-bits seed algorithm (according to HBASE-13382 said) that Random utilizes and therefore it CAN generated 32-bits numbers in a completely random way. Con­sequently, a total of (2^32)^4 possibilities can be generated by calling nextInt() 4 times, which is equivalent to 2^128.

Not really. In HBASE-13161 it shows that SecureRandom can fix the problem. Anyway, the SecureRandom is not necessary as we do not need 'secure' here. 

See this page

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator

There is a table which shows different parameter for different LCGs, I think we could make use of the one introduced by Knuth. It uses a 64 bits seed, so we can use it to generate our 16 bytes key - just use two longs, and we can make sure that a 10B test will not have collisions, as we need to generate 2^64 times to make it repetitive.

Thanks.

After saw that page, I seem understand what you mean. If the first 32-bits is same, then all 128-bits will be same.Could we solve it in other ways? What about the following solution?
{code:java}
  random bytes   nanoTime   map taskID   iteration
|----48bits----|--64bits--|----8bits---|---8bits---|{code}
It seems that we don't need to care about collision.

                Mind uploading the patch to review board?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I uploaded the patch to&nbsp; review board (see issue links).&nbsp;[~Apache9]

thanks.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Trying to follow along, I don't see listing of likelihood of collision on the wiki page?

I left some notes on rb.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Hey [~stack] I've relied on review board, that the likelihood of collision is related to the length of the period.

The period for the java Random class is 2^48, which means that when you start from 48 bits integer, after 2^48 times you will get this integer again. And since we use 32 bits integer, which is the lowest or highest 32 bits for the 48 bits integer, it will be more likely to collision.

And the period of the new Random64 is 2^64, and we will use the 64 bits long to generate keys, the likelihood of collision will be very very small.


              </div></li><li><div>
                [~Apache9] thanks.  Stick this in an?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Overall LGTM. The only concerns is about the AtomicLong in Random64.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~stack]
I saw your notes on rb. I ran 50B times nextLong for Random64, and it looks good(I have already uploaded test code on rb). I will try to test 100B tonight.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> [~Apache9]
If Random64 is not thread-safe, I could be hard to write a test case with multi threads. Single thread to generate 100B numbers is&nbsp;impossible... Random is also thread-safe.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> test

And the patch does not apply cleanly to branch-1, could you please upload your patch here? Thanks.
