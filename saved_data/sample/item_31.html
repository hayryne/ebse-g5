Currently it's 30 minutes, what should the new value be?

I think 5 minutes should be good, will do some testing.

                I think I will retract from my statement that it "used to be extremely racy and caused more troubles than it fixed", on my first test I got a stuck region in transition instead of being able to recover. The timeout was set to 2 minutes to be sure I hit it.

First the region gets closed

2 minutes later it times out:

100ms later the master finally gets the event:

{quote}

{quote}

At this point everything is fine, the region was processed as closed. But wait, remember that line where it said it was going to force an unassign?

{quote}
2012-01-04 00:18:30,322 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.zookeeper.ZKAssign: master:62003-0x134589d3db03587 Creating unassigned node for 1a4b111bcc228043e89f59c4c3f6a791 in a CLOSING state

{quote}

Now the master is confused, it recreated the RIT znode but the region doesn't even exist anymore. It even tries to shut it down but is blocked by NPEs. Now this is what's going on.

The late ZK notification that the znode was deleted (but it got recreated after):

{quote}
2012-01-04 00:19:33,285 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: The znode of region test1,089cd0c9,1325635015491.1a4b111bcc228043e89f59c4c3f6a791. has been deleted.
{quote}

Then it prints this, and much later tries to unassign it again:

And this is still ongoing.

                This stuff scares me. How do you manually recover from this?
              </div></li><li><div>
                In my case killing -9 the master did it.

                Moving to 0.92.2
              </div></li><li><div>
                No movement here. Moving to 0.96. Pull back if you feel otherwise.
              </div></li><li><div>
                We can do it in 0.96.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I will make the change in HBASE-6611.  HBASE-6977 will be helpful too.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Based on my testing for HBASE-6611/HBASE-6977, in my testing cluster, I can easily open 10+k regions on 4 nodes in around 4 minutes.  I think we are fine to set the timeout back to 5 minutes.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Make a patch to set it to 10 minutes Jimmy?  That would be a big improvement over what it currently is?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I uploaded a patch, which simply set the timeout to 10minutes and the checking period to 30 seconds.
