                This could be good on large systems, but as the strings go into the PermGen space, people are going to have to be playing with the JVM options to make that large enough, so it's not without some consequences.

                Hey Miomir. I dont think anyone's working on it. Go for it! I'd suggest looking at Guava's [Interner|http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Interners.html#newWeakInterner()] implementation
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Todd, Thanks for suggesting Guava's Interner

With the Interner, we can canonicalize counter names without filling up PermGen store, thus we don't need to use GSet&lt;String&gt;.

Judging from the issue description, there are a few counters where string instances are created every time counter name or display name is queried. But so far, I managed to identify only following one:

  @InterfaceAudience.Private
  public static class FSCounter extends AbstractCounter {
    final String scheme;
    final FileSystemCounter key;
    private long value;

    public FSCounter(String scheme, FileSystemCounter ref) {
      this.scheme = scheme;
      key = ref;
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
      return NAME_JOINER.join(scheme, key.name());
    }

    @Override
    public String getDisplayName() {
      return DISP_JOINER.join(scheme, localizeCounterName(key.name()));
    }


Could perhaps point me to some of the remaining ones?

                Patch involves memory saving achieved with the use of Guava's Interner implementation, 
including tests to verify only one copy of each distinct counter name string is stored.
Please review.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I have a couple of questions/suggestions for the patch.

Why are we using a strong interner and not a weak interner?  By using the strong version I think we will have a memory leak in the history server.  When someone declares a custom counter name it will never go away, even after that job's jhist file has been deleted out of HDFS and the counters are no longer accessible.  I think this is even worse for some of the strings that we are interning that contain the value of the counter, not just the name of the counter.  They will probably be different every time the function is called, causing some potentially very large memory leaks.  But I am not really all that sure they are called from a long running process.

It seems kind of odd where the interning calls are happening.  I doubt it is going to save any memory at all. For example we save the name of a counter inside a counter class instance and then only intern it when we return the name from the getter method.  If the intern call actually did anything it would not allow for the original name to be garbage collected, because it is still pointed to by the counter instance.  The only time we really need to intern a string is when that string is the result of reading data from a stream.  So this would be for all RPC calls and anything that parses out a string from a file.  In most other cases, like with strings that come directly from an ENUM or quoted string in the code they will already be interned by the runtime environment and adding this extra layer will only slow things down and actually use more memory.

I think it would be preferable to start out just interning the names of the counters and counter groups as they are read from a stream, like in the case of parsing the job history files.  Once that happens we can go back and evaluate if there are other places, like through RPC, that are using a lot of memory.  I would hold off on the RPC, because I am not really sure how clean it is to insert this into the protocol buffer bridge code that we use.  I think PB plays games with lazy parsing of the data and if we are not careful it could slow things down, or cause more memory usage.

                Also the patch is against trunk not 1.X.  It would be good to update the affects version and target version fields appropriately.

                Canceling patch until my concerns are addressed, and updating target/affects fields appropriately.  I targeted this for 0.23.5 because I would love to see this on branch-0.23.

                Hi Robert, thanks for the feedback. I will implement another patch (against branch-0.23) and try to address the issues you brought up.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Sorry it has taken me so long to respond. I have been a bit swamped lately.  The new patch looks really good.  It is simple and looks like it could help a lot with the memory usage.  Do you have any actual heap comparisons that you can show us?  I just have a difficult time checking in a "performance" fix without some test, manual or otherwise to show the impact it is having and if there is still more that could be done in a follow up JIRA.  I know that YourKit profiler has some nice Heap Dump analysis to look for duplicate strings. If you have some numbers ready that would be great otherwise I will try and find some time this week to see if I can come up with anything.

                Sorry, this has been a hectic week for me too. Unfortunately, I don't have any figures to share yet but will try to capture some heap dumps over the weekend.

                Patch that reduces memory consumption on History Server.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I rand some benchmarks looking at the Job History server using a jhist file for a job that had 9416 maps and 500 reducers.  I then used a combination of YourKit and jhat to look at the heap savings.

For Jhat I did the OQL {noformat}select sum(map(heap.objects("java.lang.String"),"sizeof(it)")){noformat} to get the size of all of the strings currently reachable on the heap.

I saw that nothing changed in between the base and the first patch.  Both of them had 22MB of strings in the heap.  Looking at the code that was changed to do interning, the only code that uses it was rumen.  It is still a good change, but it did not have the impact I was looking for.  So I implemented the patch I just attached which adds in interning of Strings that are parsed out of the jhist file.  This reduced the 22MB of strings to 3MB of strings.

I want to do something similar for the AM, but it is more difficult to look at, and I don't think I will have time in the near future. So if someone else could review this we can check it in and file a follow up JIRA for looking at the AM.
