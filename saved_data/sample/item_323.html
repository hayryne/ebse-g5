                </div><div><b>message:</b> [Issue 5476]Fix message deduplicate issue while using external sequence id with batch produce (#5491)

Fixes #5476 

### Motivation

Fix #5476

### Modifications

1. Add `last_sequence_id` in MessageMetadata and CommandSend, use sequence id and last_sequence_id  to indicate the batch `lowest_sequence_id` and `highest_sequence_id`.
2. Handle batch message deduplicate check in MessageDeduplication
3. Response the `last_sequence_id` to client and add message deduplicate check in client
                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>github_issues:</b> <ol><li><div><div><b>title:</b> Message deduplication is not well handled when batching is enabled with external provided sequenceId
                </div><div><b>body:</b> **Describe the bug**

Current implementation of Pulsar producer doesn't check the sequenceId when adding messages to a batch container. That results in violations to idempotent producing with external sequenceId.

**To Reproduce**

- provide 10 message with sequenceId from 0-9
- provide 10 message with sequenceId from 0-9 again
- flush the producer
- these 20 messages will be received by the consumer

**Expected behavior**

The second 10 messages will not be added to container, because they are duplicated. We can throw exceptions to client to indicate that it adds out-of-order sequence ids.

**Additional context**

There are a couple places requires attentions regarding handling batched messages with external sequenceId.

1) The logic to maintain `lastPublishedSequenceId` is incorrect when using external sequenceId : `lastSequenceIdPublished = op.sequenceId + op.numMessagesInBatch - 1;`. Because the last sequence id is an external sequence id, which can't be computed by adding the number of messages in the batch.

2) We only maintain `lastPublishedSequenceId` (which is the acked seequence id). We also need to maintain a `lastPushSequenceId` to indicate the last sequence id that a producer sends to the broker.

3) the broker need to handle the first sequence id and last sequence id in a message batch.

                @sijie 

It's hard to handle sequence id in key based batcher, if user set an external sequence id, we can't rewrite it and the sequence ids will distributed into inner batchers of key based batcher.

Current implementation will throw exception if client can ensure the message is duplicated, since we do not throws exceptions before, is it ok to throws exception?

                @codelipenghui The change is not compatible with 2.4.2, i will move the `Milestone` to `2.5.0`.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> We shouldn't trigger an error to the application when there are dups, rather the contract is that it gets an OK. In any case we need to think through the implication of triggering an error just for one message out of band. 
This is a very different behavior from the other failure modes where all the messages are failed after 1 failure.

I believe that handling this in broker side is much preferable.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                If we don't know whether is dup or not, then why are we triggering error here?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Why do we need 2 new fields here? Don't we just need to a new `last_sequence_id`? isn't `lowest_sequence_id` the same as `sequence_id` ? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I don't see how these sequence ids relate to a `Topic`.

 * What's the lowest sequenceId ? I think this only apply to 1 single batch.
 * Sequence id are *per producer* anyway
              </div></li><li><div>
                What does it mean the lowest sequence id of a producer?
              </div></li><li><div>
                It is in the inner class named MessagePublishContext of Producer
              </div></li><li><div>
                If users use the external sequence id and enable batch on producer, sequence id 1,2,3,1 will happens if we do not the check, we can just throw an exception when using the external sequence id?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, we can only add a new last_sequence_id, will fix.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It is in the inner class named PublishContext of Topic
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ok, though as in other comment, there's already a `sequenceId` field. Is that now ignored? If yes, then it should be removed. 

Also, as you can see, there's an `originalSequenceId` field. This is used in the context of geo-replication and it would have to be accounted for as well. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                &gt; It is in the inner class named PublishContext of Topic

Which already contains a sequence id field
              </div></li><li><div>
                This is not correct on 2 levels: 
 1. If `sequenceId &lt;= lastSequenceIdPushed` we don't know yet whether the message is already dup, because the previous attempt might still fail. This has to be disambiguated by the broker which has visibility at the storage level.
 2. As mentioned before, we cannot throw error when there's a duplicate, rather we need to return "ok" to the application.

                should this be highest sequence id?
              </div></li><li><div>
                1. I think we need to keep track highestSequenceId, no?
2. We should only assign the highest sequence id, no?

```
lastSequenceIdPushed = Math.max(lastSequenceIdPushed, op.lastSequenceIdPushed);
```
              </div></li><li><div>
                It seems to me that we use `highest` sequence id at the client side, but use `last` at the wire protocol and broker side. Can we make it consistent by just using `highest` across the places?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> `sequenceId` =&gt; `lowestSequenceId`

                this should :

because the duplicated publishes will still succeed, right. It can override a larger sequence Id with a smaller one.
