                Hi @wankunde 
Please find my inline comments,

- This pr is similar to
measure/src/main/scala/org/apache/griffin/measure/datasource/connector/batch/MySqlDataConnector.scala, so could you change MySqlDataConnector to a subclass of JDBCBasedDataConnector.scala. 
**If a user wants to use MySql based data source to read data then there is no direct mapping to use it. The user has to use this connector using CustomDataconnector. Using JDBCBaedData connector users can use any RDBMS which has a JDBC connector by providing driver class, adding a jar to classpath and connection details. Added default config for MySql database.** 
- Instead of adding a new dependency jar, i suggest using profile to add some other database support, like MariaDB and postgresql
**With this implementation Griffin can read data from any source which has JDBC connector by adding JDBC connector JAR to the classpath and providing connection details in a config file. I have added H2 database dependency to check the JDBC connector functionality**

I propose the feature to allow support for additional JDBC based data sources like  Oracle, Postgres, etc in batch mode. 

A sample config would look like,
