Partially Fixes Camel 14995: generates master and 3/threescale traits docs.

                </div><div><b>body:</b> This adjusts the source locations in script/gen_doc.sh to actually find the master and threescale source and thus generate the docs. The solution seems to be to list each source directory explicitly.  I haven't found any documentation on --input-dirs or been able to discover where it is used or what format it is supposed to be in.

This is seriously incomplete for a robust solution:

- possible other traits in addons need to be added to gen_doc.sh by hand.  This IMO is not likely to happen.
- There is no check that every checked in .adoc that was once generated is still generated.  In fact I have found no evidence that gen_docs.sh is run as part of ci.

I didn't see any instructions on how to generate the documentation, so I tried things until something happened.

I think there are two problems:

- some pages aren't getting generated

- this isn't blindingly obvious.

I suggest that to partly fix the second problem, the go doc generation for traits start by removing all the traits pages except the index page, traits.adoc.  At least git status will then indicate a change.  I don't know how to do this in go.

                I found how to generate the 2 missing pages that still exist, https://github.com/apache/camel-k/pull/1441.

I will leave fixing the build so this is less likely to occur again to others.
