                I believe handling of late data is also supported now. @angoenka / @y1chi could you confirm?

                Yes, late data is also supported.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks, I removed the entire unsupported features section.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The only real remaining item, "User-defined custom merging `WindowFn` (with fnapi)" is specific to portability, will add a pointer to the portable runner support table instead.
