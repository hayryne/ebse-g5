                Should I just have the below notes in the PR template?  (I have removed comments relating to JIRA)
[ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
[ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
[ ] Run `mvn clean install -Psourcecheck` in your module with source check enabled to make sure basic checks pass and there are no checkstyle violations. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.

Below are the contribution guidelines:
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I'd propose something like this:

[ ] An [issue](https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues) should be filed for the change unless this is a trivial change (fixing a typo or similar). One issue should ideally be fixed by not more than one commit and the other way round, each commit should fix just one issue, without pulling in other changes.
[ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful and properly spelled subject line and body. Copying the title of the associated issue is typically enough. Please include the issue number in the commit message prefixed by `#`.
[ ] The pull request description should explain what the pull request does, how, and why. If the info is available in the associated issue or some other external document, a link is enough.
[ ] Phrases like `Fix #&lt;issueNumber&gt;` or `Fixes #&lt;issueNumber&gt;` will auto-close the named issue upon merging the pull request. Using them is typically a good idea.
[ ] Please run `mvn process-resources -Pformat` (and amend the changes if necessary) before sending the pull request.
[ ] Contributor guide is your good friend: https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/contributor-guide.html

We should list this information when the contributor send the PR by specifying a PR template for github.  It could be annoying for the experienced contributors, but it could save us some time for the new contributors. 
Here is a draft I have, please add comment for it.
{code}
 - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.
 - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
 - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[CAMEL-XXX] Fixes bug in camel-file component`, where you replace `CAMEL-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.
 - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
 - [ ] Run `mvn clean install` in your module to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.
 - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).

                +1, we need to ask INFRA to add this PR template.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~acosentino] Actually we can do it by committing the file into .github directory.
              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks [~njiang] that sound great. [~davsclaus] does this sound good for you too? We can apply this to camel, camel-k, camel-quarkus.
              </div></li><li><div>
                A commend about "Make sure there is a [JIRA issue]" : I would rework it as for camel-k and camel-quarkus we have activated github issues so a JIRA issue is not required (the subsequent requirement need to be amended as well)
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah sounds good to me too

I would also refer people to our contribution guideline at
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

                Hi, I am a potential outreachy intern. Would it be possible for me to work this?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I have added this template to the camel, camel-k, and camel-quarkus repos
              </div></li><li><div>
                We need this for the https://github.com/apache/camel-website/ repository as well.
