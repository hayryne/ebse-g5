                Looks good, thanks Pablo!

                I believe we should use `_ReadFromBigQuery` when `known_args.native` is `False`
              </div></li><li><div>
                We have to provide `--project` parameter explicitly. This is why Python36 PostCommit has failed I think.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Maybe we should add a `--native` parameter? This would make switching between difference sources/sinks much easier.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ah I feel so dumb. Thanks Kamil. Done.

                Done. Thanks Kamil!
              </div></li><li><div>
                a native parameter for BQ Sink? (_ReadFromBQ(native=False/True) - &gt; expand depending on the parameter?)
              </div></li><li><div>
                I though about something else (a native parameter for this test), but now I see it's already here: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2bd3c5c0860846d47218b2d8715dc84e2161bdcc/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/big_query_query_to_table_pipeline.py#L55
so it's fine.
              </div></li><li><div>
                But your idea sounds good. I think we could even remove the underscore, set `True` as the default value of `native` and expose that transform to users (not in this PR though) WDYT?
