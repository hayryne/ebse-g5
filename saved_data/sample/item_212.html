## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

When creating a session directory, Thrift should create the parent directory (i.e. /tmp/base_session_log_dir) if it is not present. It is common that many tools delete empty directories, so the directory may be deleted. This can cause the session log to be disabled.

This was fixed in HIVE-12262: this PR brings it in Spark too.

## How was this patch tested?

Author: Marco Gaido &lt;marcogaido91@gmail.com&gt;

Closes #20281 from mgaido91/SPARK-23089.

                LGTM. So looks like the fix is exactly the same as Hive.

                Attach patch. The patch is not aim to solve the issue, but to:
1. Log warning messages for possible reasons session log dir could not be created
1. If the reason is operation root dir is missing, which might be the most possible one, create the operation root dir

                Patch committed to master and branch-1. Thanks Thejas for review!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sorry for chiming in late, but wouldn't the patch actually hide the underlying root problem?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> [~xuefuz] I haven't been able to reproduce this problem, except by explicitly deleting the root directory of operation logs. However, it is not clear if directory deletion was the root cause of the problem seen in production environments. In case of production environments, users tend to want resolution asap, and they restart HS2 for that, making it very hard to investigate the environment for possible reasons. The HiveServer2 logs didn't have more useful information than what is pasted in description. So the current state wasn't anyway helping in finding the root problem.

This change should hopefully keep the production systems up and running without needing a restart. 
If you have any suggestions for additional debugging that can help in detecting the cause of the failure, please suggest them. We can use a new jira for that.
