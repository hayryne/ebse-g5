- Adds ExpressionToSearchArgument visitor which converts Iceberg Expression to ORC SearchArgument. Most of the changes are isolated to this new class. Other changes are just to pass the expression from Iceberg to ORC and tests 
- Added unit tests for the same
- Copied tests equivalent to `TestMetricsRowGroupFilter` and `TestMetricsRowGroupFilterTypes` from the parquet module to `TestSearchArgument` and `TestSearchArgumentTypes`. Had to put the in `iceberg-data` as `iceberg-orc` lacks a usable readerFunc/writerFunc.
- Some tests are hit by to #961 and some due to [ORC-623](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-623) so I have disabled them for now

                +1

Looks like this conflicts with recent merges, so we'll have to fix those. Otherwise, this looks good to me.

The test failure isn't happening in master or other PRs, so I think it's safe to merge this with the python failure.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> I seem to have stumbled upon two issues with respect to Sarg evaluation in ORC

I have created two test cases at [https://github.com/shardulm94/orc/commit/b6d97cfa0325d2a14094456d338c942f61b887f2]&nbsp;for the same

In the first case, applying {{not(isNull(column))}} on a column that has all null values seems to incorrectly mark the row group as needed. This is a rather benign issue though as some extra row groups are returned.

In the second case, I create a column which has only 2 potential values, either null or 1 based on whether the row index is even or odd. So all row groups are guaranteed to have both null and 1. Applying {{not(in(column, 1))}} on this column incorrectly marks the row group as not needed. There are null values in the row group which should be matched by {{notIn(column, 1)}}. This is potentially causing some row groups to be filtered out incorrectly.

                Thank you for creating a JIRA with the test case.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thank you very much for the bug report with the unit test cases. That helped a lot. The first case, we weren't handling some of the types with all null values correctly. The second case is actually a typical misunderstanding of how null works in SQL.

When int1 is null, "not int1 in (1)" returns null. So, the predicate is returns either false or null and thus no rows should be returned. For the record, it took me a long time to get it straight and I still get it wrong more than I'd like to admit.
