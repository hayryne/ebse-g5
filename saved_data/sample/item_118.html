                How is it going with this one [~chris@die-schneider.net] ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Andrea. I did the migration in a branch but was not yet able to get all tests working. The current test failures almost all report ssl exceptions. It would be great if you could take a look at the branch: https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/CAMEL-10544
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~chris@die-schneider.net] sure, I'll do it ASAP :-)
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> From a first sight it looks like we need to hack the xmppServer in the embedded test a bit.

I suggest to create a new keystore first.

                As there's been no progress on this ticket I've looked into it and have got a patch in place. So I'm taking the liberty of assigning this to myself. And in the meanwhile smack version 4.2.0 is already out. So going to adapt the description of this ticket as well.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for looking into this. Feel free to go ahead.
