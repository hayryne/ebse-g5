                </div><div><b>description:</b> If having a CBR and the predicate throws an exception, then the next predicate is called before error handler triggers.

We should break out when exception is detected like pipeline/multicast can do.

We made the bean implement Predicate and use when(bean) instead of when(method(bean)) and the error handling appears to work correctly.
