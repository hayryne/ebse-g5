## Contribution Checklist

  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.
  
  - Name the pull request in the form "[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.
  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.

  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.
  
  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).

  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.
  
  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)

  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.

Because those type info instances in `BasicTypeInfo` are not singletons. So it's not safe to check equality with `==`. This caused some problem when I developed the test case (although that test is not the final version in this PR).

Not sure about new data types, but these old ones are static final vars that are supposed to be referenced/used when it comes to data types. Here's an example in [Orc source table ](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/5e90ed95a580aefd84b72f593954d01f4eb67f68/flink-connectors/flink-orc/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/orc/OrcTableSource.java#L397)

Can you describe the test problem? If we only use these predefined vars and not creating new ones, would it be fine? If it turns out we really need to do it, how about make changes in the later PR which adds the tests?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think the problem maybe is:
Although they are static final vars, it will be a new instance after serialize/deserialize. (The real singleton need in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21361137/deserializing-a-singleton-in-java )
New data types are the same.

The problem I hit is that we got different instances of the same type info. I don't think we have the guarantee that all type info instances used are from `BasicTypeInfo`. E.g. HiveTableOutputFormat has a `RowTypeInfo` field that needs to be serialized. And after deserialization, the type info instances in this `RowTypeInfo` are different from those in `BasicTypeInfo`.

BTW, I'd like to confirm whether type info instances are supposed to be singletons? Judging from the code, it's not designed that way. So I think it's always safer to call `equals` to check equality (guess that's also why BasicTypeInfo overrides the `equals` method). Is that correct?

Yes, it's always safer to call `equals` to check equality. (Scala's "==" is equals)

                Have you discussed about this? IMO the blink planner should not be dependent.
              </div></li><li><div>
                we can't because flink type is not enum
              </div></li><li><div>
                It doesn't directly check input argument. It checks whether we can get a StorageFormatDescriptor based on the input argument.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It's not. We need a `TypeInfo` here and `HiveTypeUtil.toHiveType()` gives the name of a hive type. But I guess this method can be moved to `HiveTypeUtil`
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes we have. I thought the blink planner will eventually replace flink's. Is there any reason why we can't depend on it?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> it's not needed anymore, will remove it

                Firstly, this will not happen very soon. Secondly, i don't see a reason that a planner should be dependent for a connector. Could you explain the reason?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think the reason is `BatchTableSink` with `BoundedStream` still in blink planner.
We need unify `TableSource` and `TableSink` interface and  move them to api.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, we need blink planner for `BatchTableSink ` at the moment
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm afraid the source/sink interfaces are still under discussion and the interfaces which blink planner currently used are highly possible not the final solution. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for the explanation. So the suggestion is we should instead implement `BatchTableSink` in flink-table-api-java-bridge, right?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think it's also not a good idea since we are deprecating `DataSet` now. How about:
1. Decouple the implementation details for this functionality and first merge the parts which unrelated to TableSink interface, like provide an OutputFormat and test it independently.
2. Provide the TableSink implementation after we decide and merge the TableSink interface into `common` or `api` package, and add some integration tests with it.

              </div></li><li><div>
                `toHiveTypeInfo()` and `toHiveType()` are somewhat duplicated, and it may be hard to keep them in sync. Can we try to unify them so we have only one path to covert Flink type to Hive type?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I think it's possible that a Hive partition can be different from its table in terms of properties. For instance, a partition can has a different storage format. For now, I think we can add a todo item.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I'll use Hive's `TypeInfoFactory` to achieve this. Alternatively, we can maintain a mapping from type name to `TypeInfo` ourselves.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The Flink runtime passes this number as the ID of the sub-task. This logic is copied from our internal Blink implementation. I'll remove it for now. We can revisit this when we hit real issues with big IDs.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Yes it's called on every row. But is's not used to compute the partition value of a row. It's used to convert each field in a row to its external type. So we can't get rid of this overhead.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                does the arity remain the same in the lifecycle of a `HiveTableOutputFormat` instance or can it vary? If the same, shall we make it a member variable and not compute for every record?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Makes sense. PR updated.
