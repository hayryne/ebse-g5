                </div><div><b>message:</b> ZOOKEEPER-3719: Fix C Client compilation issues

This series fixes the following:

  * Actually build the C code in `full-build` profile:

    Without this, the C client is configured by Maven, but not built.
    This helps avoiding compilation errors, but has other downsides.

  * Fix Windows compilation issue:

    The backport of ZOOKEEPER-1105 introduced a compilation error in
    one of the `WIN32` branches of the C client code.

    This happened because the "socket object" does not use the same
    representation on `branch-3.5` (as it does not include the SSL
    support introduced by ZOOKEEPER-2122).

  * Fix GCC 8.3 compilation issues:

    `Makefile.am` uses `-Werror`, and this causes the build to fail
    with GCC 8.3, which warns about a couple possible buffer overruns.

                (Note that the C code accidentally builds—at least partly—if one does not use `-DskipTests`, as the tests depend on it.  I was puzzled not to find anything while iterating on the GCC build issues.)

Pinging @symat as he can probably ack/review the Windows build fix.

                Oh I have just seen the JIRA

Please refer to it properly in the PR
              </div></li><li><div>
                @eolivelli: Ah, sorry; I got the commit headers right, but forgot to update the PR title.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The patch is against branch-3.5.7, so whoever commits, please make sure to cherry-pick to branch-3.5. (There's a pretty good chance this warning is for me :) )

I'm testing the build, I have older version of GCC so issue did not show to me.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @nkalmar: Right; everything gets build and tested as long as you don't use `-DskipTests`... in which case it only configures, but doesn't build anything.  Not the biggest issue, but it was a bit confusing :)

I included the GCC fixes because I was hitting them on NixOS 19.09.  Not a big issue either, though `-Werror` means that the build fails instead of just being noisy.

As for the `WIN32` bit, that is a real regression.  (But then I don't know how many people use the C client under Windows.)

(Feel free to cherry-pick a subset of the patches; I won't mind.)

                Merged to 3.5 and 3.5.7. Thanks @ztzg !

                great, thanks @ztzg !

                Did you take this change from master?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Initially, yes.  But it did not work as-is, because `master` uses `&lt;tasks&gt;` and it seems the Maven plugins pulled by 3.5 are missing support for it—so I adapted it by cargo-culting (and later cleaning up) the surrounding stanzas.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> The C client included in {{release-3.5.7-rc0}} and {{release-3.5.7-rc1}} suffers from a few issues:

# It configures, but "forgets" to build the C code in the {{full-build}} profile;
# Compilation actually fails with GCC 8.3, as the the {{Makefile}} uses {{-Werror}} and the compiler detects a couple possible buffer overruns;
# The {{WIN32}} branch of the code does not compile because of a change in socket representation.

This should probably be set to "blocker," but I don't know if the C client is supposed to block a release.  Oh, and the first issue, at least, also existed in 3.5.6—and it seems nobody complained&nbsp;:)

A "pull request" is in the works.
