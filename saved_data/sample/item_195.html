                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## What is the purpose of the change
This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature. 

## Brief change log
  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call. 
 
## Verifying this change
This change added tests and can be verified as follows:
 - Added a `testRateLimiting()` test in the `KafkaConsumerThreadTest` class.
 - Manually verified the change using a test application and screenshots of results are added [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11501?focusedCommentId=16762965&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16762965). 
- Added a `testRateLimitedConsumer()` to `Kafka09ITCase`

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## What is the purpose of the change
This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature. 

## Brief change log
  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call.

  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call. 
 
## Verifying this change
This change added tests and can be verified as follows:
 - Added a `testRateLimiting()` test in the `KafkaConsumerThreadTest` class.
 - Manually verified the change using a test application and screenshots of results are added [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11501?focusedCommentId=16762965&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16762965). 
- Added a `testRateLimitedConsumer()` to `Kafka09ITCase`

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## What is the purpose of the change
This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature.

There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature. 

## Brief change log
  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call. 
 
## Verifying this change
This change added tests and can be verified as follows:
 - Added a `testRateLimiting()` test in the `KafkaConsumerThreadTest` class.
 - Manually verified the change using a test application and screenshots of results are added [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11501?focusedCommentId=16762965&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16762965). 
- Added a `testRateLimitedConsumer()` to `Kafka09ITCase`

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## What is the purpose of the change
This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature. 

## Brief change log
  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call. 
 
## Verifying this change
This change added tests and can be verified as follows:
 - Added a `testRateLimiting()` test in the `KafkaConsumerThreadTest` class.
 - Manually verified the change using a test application and screenshots of results are added [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11501?focusedCommentId=16762965&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16762965). 
- Added a `testRateLimitedConsumer()` to `Kafka09ITCase`

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## What is the purpose of the change
This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled. In such a scenario, ratelimiting on the FlinkKafkaConsumer is a useful feature. 

## Brief change log
  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call.

  - This feature is set by using a feature flag - `kafka.consumer.ratelimiting.enabled`
  -  A`RateLimiterFactory` is used to configure and create a Guava [RateLimiter](https://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/index.html?com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html) with a desired rate.
  -  The `consumer.poll()` part of the `run()` loop in the `KafkaConsumerThread` is modularized into a `getRecordsFromKafka()` method.
  - The rate is controlled by setting the bytes received from Kafka as the parameter to the `acquire()` call. 
 
## Verifying this change
This change added tests and can be verified as follows:
 - Added a `testRateLimiting()` test in the `KafkaConsumerThreadTest` class.
 - Manually verified the change using a test application and screenshots of results are added [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11501?focusedCommentId=16762965&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16762965). 
- Added a `testRateLimitedConsumer()` to `Kafka09ITCase`

This pull request adds a ratelimiting feature to the Flink Kafka consumer. There are instances when a Flink job that reads from Kafka can read at a significantly high throughput (particularly while processing a backlog) and degrade the underlying Kafka cluster. While Kafka quotas are perhaps the best way to enforce this ratelimiting, there are cases where such a setup is not available or easily enabled.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for taking a look @becketqin and @tweise. I think adding an interface that can extend to other connectors  and also not restricting consumers to use Guava's RateLimiter makes sense. Maybe something simple like below will work for the interface?

```
public interface FlinkConnectorRateLimiter {
	public void open(StreamingRuntimeContext runtimeContext);
	public &lt;T&gt; T create(long rate);
	public void setRate(long rate);
	public void close();
}
```
And connector specific RateLimiters can be defined to implement this interface. 

Also, point taken on keeping these discussions on the mailing list in the future. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @tweise @becketqin I updated the code to include a `FlinkConnectorRateLimiter` and also included a `DefaultKafkaRateLimiter` that implements the interface using Guava's RateLimiter. Let me know what you think. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @tweise I added a test to the `Kafka09ITCase` that runs a job that uses the ratelimiter (and asserts an approximate rate). I also updated the `GuavaFlinkConnectorRateLimiter` to be serializable (which was a bug that I discovered on writing the IT case). Let me know your thoughts!
              </div></li><li><div>
                As per discussion on the [mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3de9d2353cf22aea0448fb744314103b5f88195216acc3bff449354a@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E), I have moved `FlinkConnectorRateLimiter` and `GuavaFlinkConnectorRateLimiter` to `org.apache.flink.api.common.io.ratelimiting`. The latest commit includes changes to update references. One slightly unfortunate consequence of doing this is including the shaded guava dependency in the `flink-core/pom.xml`. I don't know if that's acceptable?

@tweise PTAL when you have a chance and let me know what you think!

                Do we need this prefix? Can all the source and sink share the same configuration name？ If we do need the prefix, can we put this in somewhere like `FlinkKafkaConsumerBase`?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Do we want to directly import class from the shaded jar?
              </div></li><li><div>
                It is a little unfortunate that we have to make an additional iteration over the records to get the sizes. Another option is putting the throttling logic in the `AbstractFetcher`.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Can we move this class to a separate package so it can be shared by all the other connectors?
For example, a `flink-connector-throttling` module in `flink-connectors`.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Personally, I prefer independent configurations if possible. I am wondering if the following configuration names would be clear enough:
```
CONSUMER_MAX_BYTES_PER_SECOND_CONFIG="consumer.max.bytes.per.second"
CONSUMER_MAX_RECORDS_PER_SECOND_CONFIG="consumer.max.records.per.second"
```
In the future we can add configurations for the producers.

The default value of the above configurations could be either be set to Long.MAX_VALUE, or -1 to indicate not throttling.

                There is not need for this prefix. Rate limiting should be configured per consumer. I have a more general comment on that.
              </div></li><li><div>
                There is no need for this configuration. When a rate limiter is set on the consumer, then it is "enabled", otherwise it is null and no rate limiting takes place.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I would suggest to remove this property based configuration and have instead properties on the rate limiter that the user sets directly.
              </div></li><li><div>
                This import should not be here at all after we find the appropriate abstraction. But in general, we should use the shaded dependency or not?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Makes sense to enable ratelimiting based on whether or not a consumer's ratelimiter is null. To @becketqin's point, I think we would still need to pass the rate value itself from the consumer to its ratelimiter. Perhaps we could standardize that property across connectors?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, I think it makes sense to move this logic to a separate package within the `flink-connectors` module.  I will do that once we reach an agreement on the discussion. Thanks for suggesting.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The reason for doing the iteration here was because we needed the record sizes prior to deserialization and I believe the records are already deserialized at the `AbstractFetcher` level?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah, I think the consumer prefix is not adding any value here. Makes sense to not have it. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                yes, if you want to use something from guava then you should use the shaded dependency. The only exception is if a another dependency exposes a guava-related API.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @zentol @tweise Just for my own curiosity. I agree that we should shade the jar to avoid interference with other user imports. What I am wondering is how should that be done. Whether it should be done in the pom.xml or from the import explicitly.  I am not sure about the difference between those two ways. But I did not see such explicit imports in Flink anywhere else. Am I missing something?
              </div></li><li><div>
                The `AbstractFetcher` has two subclasses - `Kafka09Fetcher` and `Kafka08Fetcher`. The serialization is done inside them. 

`Kafka09Fetcher` is sort of an abstract fetcher for Kafka 0.9+. `Kafka08Fetcher` is more of a legacy. Maybe we can just do that in `Kafka09Fetcher`?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I have not made this change yet. Perhaps we could do this as a part of augmenting the consumer and making the code more customizable (in another PR i.e.) ?

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I ended up passing the rate value to the setter that sets the ratelimiter on the consumer. Let me know if that looks alright.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Why the second parameter? That should be a setter on `DefaultKafkaRateLimiter`
              </div></li><li><div>
                Since there is nothing Kafka specific here, but the implementation is specific to Guava, would `GuavaFlinkConnectorRateLimiter` be a better name?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> This is confusing, the rate limiter was already created by the user.

                Thanks for catching. Updated to call `close()` in  the `KafkaConsumerThread` both in the `finally{}` block of the `run()` method and in the `shutdown()` method.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Updated to only have `open()` and also moved the `create()` logic in the `GuavaFlinkConnectorRateLimiter` to reflect this.

What makes this a bit shaky is the fact that you could get a false positive when the initialization/execution overhead is just enough to hide a faster read. I'm not sure how that can be done in a much better way though. Perhaps measure the time in the deserializer? Otherwise we can leave it as is.

                I added details to the javadoc with the test expectation. Moving it to deserializer is a good idea. I updated the test. The gain is ~ 200 ms (not all that much but closer than what I had before). Thanks for the suggestion.

                @becketqin I'm not familiar with shaded dependency but let's say that it is a common case we use such explicit imports. You can just search "import org.apache.flink.shaded.guava18` and there are over 100 use points.
