                </div><div><b>body:</b> First of all, don't try reading central Scala API rewrite commit. It's basically a rewrite from Scratch, so the diff won't make a lot of sense. Just look at the result.

The commits before the central commit massage the rest of the system into shape to allow the rewrite. The commits after change some small things and add examples and ITCases.

@mbalassi: How's that for working on Sundays... :smile_cat:

- Documentation has not been updated to reflect the changes. (not only the scala-specific documentation, also for example this one: http://flink.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6-incubating/run_example_quickstart.html)
- Hadoop2 builds are not passing 

Would it make sense to use tabs in the scala code as well?
Should we add something like checkstyle for scala into our maven build?

I tried integrating this into the flink-scala project for generating javadocs for scala: https://github.com/typesafehub/genjavadoc
I did the integration for the old flink-scala. Maybe you can take a look into this and see if you can get it running.
I'm currently changing the website build process to build javadocs for the whole project, so it would be nice to have javadocs for the scala API in place for the next release.

                This is what I tried so far: https://github.com/rmetzger/incubator-flink/commit/875d8b07e826a337b391008af3951a6c61beb3a5

              </div></li><li><div>
                Does it have to be Javadoc? Since in Scala they normally use ScalaDoc.

              </div></li><li><div>
                It seems to be impossible to mix Scaladoc and Javadoc. Since most of our project has been written in Java, I think it would be easier and better to use Javadoc.

If its impossible to get it running, we can also add another link into our documentation, just for the Scaladoc.

              </div></li><li><div>
                But people using the Scala API would probably like to have ScalaDoc? I'll look into genjavadoc nevertheless.

For the documentation, I would like to rewrite the Java documentation to have tabs for selecting Java or Scala for the code examples. Since the concepts are exactly the same now. What do you think?

Regarding tabs in Scala source: I think it's highly unusual.

              </div></li><li><div>
                I think having only one documentation "Flink programming guide" that is language independent would be great!

I'm okay with spaces in the Scala source. We should decide for one and then enforce it using something like checkstyle.

                Where does the hadoop2 build fail? Both on travis and on my machine "mvm -Dhadoop.profile=2 clean verify" works.

              </div></li><li><div>
                The status box above the comment field say "The Travis CI build failed". When clicking the "Details" button, this page appears: https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-flink/builds/35272833
But you are right, your latest commit seems to build.

              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm integrating this: http://www.scalastyle.org

I'll use the spark scalastyle config. Do you think I have to mention it anywhere? It's also Apache Licensed after all...

              </div></li><li><div>
                I added Scalastyle.

              </div></li><li><div>
                I think you don't have to mention it, from a legal point of view, but I think its nice.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah, I'm saying in a comment that it's adapted from Spark.

                What would you say about merging this now?

@rmetzger I think I addressed all your (correct) complaints. :smiley_cat: 

              </div></li><li><div>
                I think the code and docs are in good shape.

Can you squash some commits while merging, to cleanup the history (for example all the "fix formatting" and "typo" commits)

              </div></li><li><div>
                +1
Documentation looks good.
Can you do me a little favor if you're going to work on this anyways? can you remove the "Hadoop Compatability" page? It does not contain any text and its misspelled. We should use JIRA to keep work-items around, not empty documentation pages ;)

                spaces vs tabs?
