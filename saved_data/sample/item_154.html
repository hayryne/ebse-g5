                </div><div><b>description:</b> As discussed on the list we should update the package names sooner rather than later. This issue is meant to track the progress of that task.

To see what packages need conversion, use:

{noformat}find . -name brooklyn | grep -v target | grep -v org/apache/brooklyn | grep -v com/acme/sample{noformat}

To look for stale items in a project once you think you've updated, the following can be useful (it's imperfect, but handy):

{noformat}grep -r "[^e].brooklyn[^\w]" . | grep -v import | grep -v artifactId{noformat}

In some cases, split packages are being addressed by this refactoring. ([~hzbarcea@gmail.com] is there a separate issue for that?)

To minimize interference I added the list of subprojects. Please add your name to the module you want to take care of so others would know you are taking care of it. I'd suggest adding a check mark to what's already done and committed (v) and a (userid) for wip.  Note however that things may not have been updated, so also use the command above.

                How can I add myself to your list? Perhaps a google spreasheet would be better for tracking the status.

I have the following done, and I will cherry-pick them onto master one by one, for review and merging. You can assign them to me on that chart.

A few comments: 

1. ./usage/archetypes/quickstart/   -&gt;  only folder ./usage/archetypes/quickstart/src/brooklyn-sample/ is relevant; the other folders are copies of it
2. ./usage/logback-includes/   -&gt; needs removal of brooklyn and io.brooklyn names from XMLs at the end, and that's it
3. parent and downstream-parent -&gt; needs removal of brooklyn.* from maven-bundle-plugin, and that's it

    Don't worry about it here. Let's fix it by moving MultiCloudSnitch somewhere more sensible in a completely different PR!

    brooklyn-software-osgi: add org.apache package prefix

    Refs BROOKLYN-162
    
    All tests that are part of the Integration profile are marked WIP.
    I did not run any live tests.
    
    There are 2 more issues for this project:
    
    1. src/test/resources contains a hello-world.jar that is used as test OSGi bundle. Shouldn't this be part of the osgi-test-bundles processed by hadrian?
    
    2. Talking of split packages: the sources also contain the classes org.osgi.jmx.Item and org.osgi.jmx.JmxConstants, each with the following note:
    
    ```java
    /*
     * BROOKLYN NOTE: This is a verbatim copy of the original in org.osgi.enterprise-4.2.0, 
     * reproduced here to avoid pulling in the rest of that bundle and its chain of dependencies.
     * The only difference is this comment and the suppress warnings.
     */
    ```
    
    As far as I can see org.osgi.enterprise-4.2.0 has no dependencies, though it does bundle a lot more classes.

    @ygy there's a test failure: `org.apache.brooklyn.rest.domain.EntitySummaryTest.testSerializeToJSON`.
    
    The test says it's expecting `"type":"org.apache.brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer"` but found `"type":"brooklyn.entity.webapp.tomcat.TomcatServer"`.
    
    This fails because https://github.com/apache/incubator-brooklyn/blob/master/software/webapp/src/main/java/brooklyn/entity/webapp/tomcat/TomcatServer.java has not yet been updated.
    
    Did you modify `fixtures/entity-summary.json` in this PR?

    @bostko I saw what you did in this pull request too late. The build failed because you missed a couple of imports in the quickstart archetype, but by now I think I created a bunch of conflicts with the last commits. For the package rename I think we should go straight to using the convention we agreed upon to avoid the split package problem.
    
    I don't know if you want to rework this. If not that's ok, I can take care of it.

    Seems we have both performed the rename on the same packages (see PR #820)
    
    From my quick read it seems you have missed some classpath://brooklyn/entity/messaging references within the default configkeys. At the same time, I failed to update the yamls in brooklyn-launcher.
    
    I guess merging both PRs will bring in the good stuff from both.

    @hzbarcea can you kick off asfbot again please (e.g. by closing + reopening PR)?
    
    From the stdout, the build looks like it succeeded, but then finished with:
    
        Waiting for Jenkins to finish collecting data
        Build timed out (after 40 minutes). Marking the build as aborted.
        channel stopped
        Build was aborted
        Putting comment on the pull request
        Finished: ABORTED
    
    Normally the last lines are:

    Looks good to merge other than that asfbot build failure. In fact, can we conclude that the build really was successful (and that it was just an asfbot strangeness) given that the build stdout did say the usual:

    The @asfbot tests passed and a re-test against a current master passes too. I am merging it to avoid a painful conflict resolution.

    Thanks @iyovcheva - I think we should move to renaming things in bigger chunks than this. Our package renaming is taking a long time, and multiple change PRs are ending up causing merge conflicts for each other. I think we're going to have a blast at lots of renaming tonight.
    
    I'll merge this first though (after I check that it builds locally for me).

    Actually, @ahgittin has commented on IRC that he will try to "finish the rest" tonight.
    
    I expect he'll rename these packages to a prefix like `org.apache.brooklyn.location.jclouds.*`, so me merging this could cause him merge conflicts.
    
    I'll leave @ahgittin to decide whether to merge this, or whether his work is going to supersede this tonight.

    hi @iyovcheva can you close?  this conflicts w #844 which does a slightly different rename (inter alia).  any comments you have there are welcome.

        move WindowsPerformanceCounterSensors to o.a.b.core.sensor.windows
        
        - Was previously in software-base, in o.a.b.sensor.winrm.
        - Renamed to .windows to be consistent with .feed.windows
        - Moved to core to be consistent with .sensor.ssh and .sensor.http

        Move o.a.b.sensor.ssh contents to core
        
        - Moved SshCommandEffector (which strangely was in .sensor.ssh) to
          o.a.b.core.effector.ssh
        - Moved SshCommandSensor (which strangely was in .sensor.ssh) to
          o.a.b.core.sensor.ssh
        - Changed these classes to reference config in BrooklynConfigKeys,
          rather than in SoftwareProcess.*
        - Added BrooklynConfigKeys.SHELL_ENVIRONMENT, which SoftwareProcess
          now uses.
        - Made SshCommandSensor.makeCommandExecutingInDirectory public and
          marked as @Beta (was previously static package-private, for use
          by SshCommandEffector as well).
        - Split SshCommandIntegrationTest into two:
          - SshCommandEffectorIntegrationTest (and removed unnecessary tempFile
            creation)
          - SshCommandSensorIntegrationTest (and moved tempFile creation/deletion
            into setUp/tearDown)

    looks great, merging.
    
    i don't like the way related items are split up e.g. `Windows*` spread across a sub-package `windows` in different parents `o.a.b.feed` and `o.a.b.core.sensor`.
    
    however rather than resolving this with higher-level `windows` namespace inside `core` (which i was doing, but you've talked me out of it) i think we should resolve this with finer granular projects, so there is e.g. `o.a.b.ecosystem.windows` which contains windows-specific things.  this would justify osgi hierarchy dominating most things as osgi project and product area become more closely aligned.  (somehow we'll have to manage the package transition but we will find a way!)

    not immediately btw -- the osgi project expansion can wait for a while, maybe after 1.0.  @hzbarcea tells me we can have multiple repos at apache within this project (that is distinct from *apache* sub-projects), so we could e.g. move things like chef and windows etc into a `brooklyn-ecosystems` repo.

    Fix add-app-wizard for enums (WIP)

    Attempting to fix:
    
    ![screen shot 2015-10-07 at 22 53 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/593113/10352437/f7f3739c-6d46-11e5-9302-4171b4fdd0e5.png)
    
    My change reverts a change that sneaked in as part of the commit "[BROOKLYN-162] package rename to org.apache.brooklyn: software/webapp"!
    
    However, when I just ran with it in a downstream project, it seemed not to alter the behaviour at all.
    
    Maybe my javascript was cached or maybe the downstream build actually downloaded the latest snapshot Brooklyn (rather than taking my local build)?!
