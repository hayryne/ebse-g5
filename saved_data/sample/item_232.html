                </div><div><b>body:</b> Currently, if the delivery service configuration requires a new package that is not installed, ORT cannot install it unless it is run in badass mode. We should update ORT to install missing packages during a syncds run, for example, if a new plugin is required.

This is currently handled via package profile parameters that are used during a badass mode.
