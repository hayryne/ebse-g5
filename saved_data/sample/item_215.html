                Folks, facing a strange issue, the spec I wrote is working on my laptop, but not on travis.

OK

```

It used to work earlier, when I had `job_id` as a param in `__init__` of `TaskInstance`, which I removed and setting it explicitly from the tests. Could Travis is using somekind of DB caching while doing join calls, cause in Rails world its quite common with RSpec.

                As the variable `ti` is coming out of a db query and doesn't flow through TIs `__init__` method, cause of that all fields which are not backed by db didn't get initialise and throws error in `ti.get_template_context` later. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                Sure but that does answer my question. What if test_mode needs to be true? Can that be the case?

              </div></li><li><div>
                yeah, may be.. changed it to fetch from config.. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                test_mode is set per instance and not by the configuration, eg. by run. I'm not sure how "test_mode" behaves in context of killing a zombie. Is it really required? If it is it needs to be derived differently

              </div></li><li><div>
                @bolkedebruin I believe that if `test_mode` is true then that `ti` would never have been picked by `kill_zombie` code, so I'd it `False` initially. 

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Could also be

``` python
'Marked zombie job {ti} as {ti.state}'.format(ti=ti)

                👍, I missed this was in a logger call.

              </div></li><li><div>
                @bolkedebruin can we take a decision on this? As per my understanding it should be always `False` here , otherwise that `TI` won't end up in `kill_zombie` method. 

@mistercrunch  @r39132 @criccomini can you guys throw some more light on it. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                @msumit stick with .format . Landscape is old fashioned here. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                @msumit It should definitely not come the global config. Please explain why it would always be False here (you could be right, didn't trace it throughout the code).

              </div></li><li><div>
                @bolkedebruin as per my understanding, if a task ran in `test_mode` it would not have db entries... and as `kill_zombie` picks up `TIs` via a db query, its guaranteed that all entries it picked are not of `test_mode`...

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @bolkedebruin : even if we are using `{}` style, we would want to update logger and pass the arguments separately. The advantage to using `%` style with the current logger configuration is that it is possible to use structured logging and access the parameters separately from the string.

                @gwax Format provides support for specifying format params both positionally and via named (i.e. keyword) params : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17895835/format-strings-and-named-arguments-in-python

              </div></li><li><div>
                @msumit not sure I see how `job_id` is being used

              </div></li><li><div>
                @jlowin `job_id` is being used only for testing purposes (see line 216 at tests/models.py).. as `kill_zombie` do a db query against `TI` and `LJ` tables, and I need a valid value there to return some rows out of query.. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                Got it. Looks ok to me.

              </div></li><li><div>
                @mistercrunch what does `TaskInstance.job_id` do? it seems to be used in a few places but I can't find any place that sets it... is it a foreign key of some kind?

              </div></li><li><div>
                It's important, the Job absctraction is actually the one looking for an external kill signal when clearing running tasks
              </div></li><li><div>
                What's this change for? It seems somewhat related to the this PR?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Won't handle failure already emit a log line saying it's marking the task as up for retry/failed?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Rather: you add a param to the constructor but don't seem to use it (and the pattern the rest of the code uses is just to set `ti.job_id = job_id`
              </div></li><li><div>
                Okay, I saw the previous comments on this. Rather than adding a new form to the constructor we should just set the property on the instance in the tests (around line 1363)
              </div></li><li><div>
                @ashb yes it does, but in `handle_failure` we call `task.on_failure_callback(context)` which might change the state of the `ti` (which happens in our case). Hence a final msg about status of zombie job would be helpful. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                What do the log lines look like with this in place please?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @ashb here you go. 
```

```

In one of our case we use `handle_failure` to change the state of TI to success (4th log line), which eventually changes the line 5 accordingly. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @ashb thanks for the suggestion. Changed the spec code, so no changes required in here. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                This looks incorrect - log.exception basically does this already (but includes useful traceback). Is there some reason we need this change?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Oh were we actually logging the error twice? I think this line should stay (unmodified) and the log at the end just removed.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                sorry, I somehow thought that `error` is just a string (prolly it was when I first wrote it), and as we are passing a string error message, was seeing `NoneType: None` at the end of the log. Will revert it back. And yes, we were printing the same message twice so removed the last one. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Oh - I now see what is going on with the `log.error` vs `log.exception` - the other place handle_failure is used is for a task actually failing, after an exception has been raised. `log.exception` is the same as `log.error(..., exc_info=True)` which just automatically includes exception info.

If this produces sensible logging output now I think this PR looks good now.
              </div></li><li><div>
                yeah, the log is giving correct msg, that we `got a zombie` instead of announcing it dead already. As at this point no one is sure what task's handle_failure would be doing, so finally we are stating that after we are pass through it. Here is one such [example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/qubole_hook.py#L98).

[AIRFLOW-437] Send TI context in kill zombies

Fix to provide proper TI context while calling ti.handle_failure during
kill_zombies, as without the context handler_failure is of no use and
its equivalent of marking those TIs as failed directly.

kill_zombies, as without the context handler_failure is of no use and
its equivalent of marking those TIs as failed directly.
