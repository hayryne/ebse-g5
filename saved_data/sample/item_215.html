    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line
    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters
    3. Subject does not end with a period
    4. Subject uses the imperative mood ("add", not "adding")
    5. Body wraps at 72 characters
    6. Body explains "what" and "why", not "how"

- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- "*.py" | flake8 --diff`
