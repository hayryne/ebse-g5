                Attaching patch against 0.8.

Basically this makes SP.mutate() handle a list of mixed RowMutation and CounterMutation (but then each mutation use the right path). This is needed since a batch_mutate() can now mix those.

This has an unfortunate consequence however in that I don't think there is a way to distinguish the writeStats of standard insert of the ones of counter insert anymore, and thus this patch remove the latter ones (and count everything in writeStat).

&gt; ...and thus this patch remove the latter ones (and count everything in writeStat).
I'm fine with this, since a counter is as "real" a write as any other. _But_ I do think we should record the latencies for the replicate-on-write stage like we do for the read and mutation stages on a per column family basis. I can tackle it in a separate ticket if you'd like.

PS: Thanks for removing this line!

Thanks Sylvain!

bq. writeLocallyAndReplicate doesn't always perform a local mutation, so it should probably be renamed

Renamed it to performWrite (since it mostly simply imply a so-called writePerformer).

bq. Since mutateCounter and writeLocallyAndReplicate are symmetrical and are called depending on whether an IMutation is an instance of CounterMutation, could we move them onto IMutation, and polymorphically decide the behavior?

Hum, they are not really so symmetrical. In particular writeLocallyAndReplicate (or performWrite as it is called nowadays) really is polymorphic over the IMutation used.
So the only seem we we could do (at least easily) is moving some of mutateCounter in CounterMutation, but not sure it will look so great. Also, it is probably nice to keep all the code related to the write/read protocol in StorageProxy (doing otherwise would be like moving the query code out of CFStore, nobody wants that :D)

Make sense, but I'm also in favor of moving this to some other ticket.
