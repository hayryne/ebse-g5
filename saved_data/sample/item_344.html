                 this property shouldn't be used directly; it exists solely to document the default value
 defined by its use in AccumuloVFSClassLoader when generating the property documentation

                </div><div><b>message:</b> Fix #1202 Correct documented vfs cache dir default

Update the default value for general.vfs.cache.dir to reflect the actual
default used in AccumuloVFSClassLoader. Also update the description to
more accurately represent how the value is used as a base directory for
a subdirectory which the vfs class loader code uses.

                </div><div><b>body:</b> As part of the commons-configuration2 update, I changed the default value for this property, so we could drop custom property interpolation features (users would instead rely on interpolation within their site file, if they really wanted a different value). However, I believe it's possible that this property was only documenting the default behavior of the AccumuloVFSClassLoader in accumulo-start module. I don't think this default value did anything outside of the documentation generation.

Usages of this property need to be checked to ensure my belief is correct, and that the generated documentation matches the behavior of its usages (either by changing AccumuloVFSClassLoader or by changing the default value of this property back for documentation purposes).
