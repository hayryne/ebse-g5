                another important feature is the ability to display individual icons per node.

                When this new compontend will be relased? Can i use this one in the currently version of tobago?
              </div></li><li><div>
                The tree is available in the tobago-sandbox.

The sandbox will be included in the next 1.0.15 release.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Removing this feature:
* mix fix nodes with model nodes
It would be nice for rapid prototyping, but make the model abstraction very hard.
It also have problems with the tree in the sheet feature (TOBAGO-1049)

I see the possibility to make repid prototying in a different way without these disadvantages.
