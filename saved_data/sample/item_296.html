                Looking at this, it seems this new DirectBindings method completely will ignore wildcard config. Im not so sure this is a good idea, as these should be taken into account.

e.g. what happens if someone is using different wildcards? Also it be good to add test cases where alternative wildcards are used to make sure removeAddress still works.

                The getDirectBindings() method just does an equals() call and compares address names to see if they match exactly (ie simple strings).  It's not doing a match so there is no wild card involved.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> I was doing some testing with wildcard addresses and I noticed that the broker does not allow an address to be removed when linked with a binding for another address (such as with wildcard addresses).&nbsp; For example, if there are two addresses created called durable.# and durable.test and a durable subscription is created on durable.# then later on the durable.test address is unable to be removed even though there is no direct consumer on that address.

It seems like this should be allowed and I'm not sure if this would be considered a bug or an improvement.&nbsp; I will attach a very simple unit test that demonstrates the issue I am having.

                Perhaps we should be using the&nbsp;getMatchingBindings() method call instead of getBindingsForAddress() method call when checking for bindings here:&nbsp;https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/blob/master/artemis-server/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/artemis/core/postoffice/impl/PostOfficeImpl.java#L535
