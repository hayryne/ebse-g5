                I dont think this brings any value, and it also breaks the output now.

                I didn't explain this to well. Sorry about that.

Today we improved the JSon schema that is generated by Camel and it uses boolean, numeric, types etc. This is done by ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10842

So we dont need this jackson and can rely on the same parser all over in Camel.

                @davsclaus I don't fully understand where it's breaking the output.  Is there a failing test case or perhaps you can point me to example that causes a failure?

                Camel is now already more type-safe in the generated json schema. Jackson is not needed. Instead we use the same parser all around in Camel.

                @davsclaus I'm mostly trying to take fix code like can be seen at:
https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1470/files#diff-419cb00ca9372e6591f0fc003d48fda9L357
which will break json encoding depending on content of what's in the description.  Better to have a clean data model and let jackson properly encode the json.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The description is being sanitized for invalid content
