I recommend adding `--max-line-length 80` into luacheck, and fix all the lines exceed 80 characters.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> The specification of 80 characters forces programmer to design concise variable name, function name and literals, I don't think it makes the code more awkward to read (if so, community can refactor it :) ),  so i think we should obey the code style specification.

                Okay, I follow the decision of the community. Hmmm.

                &gt; The length we chose is 100.

I think `100` is fine.

we checked it by `luacheck` too.
