                @mistercrunch I'm not very familiar with coveralls, is there anything I can do about the failure here? It's saying none of the new code is tested but of course it is in the unit test.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Coveralls isn't happy because the new code you wrote isn't covered by tests and overall brings the coverage of the repository down. You should write a unit test that calls the method.

Landscape is reporting 14 things to lint as well. I think we should have PR authors fix most if not all of those. We can change the policy and specify rules we want to skip in `.landscape.yml`

You can disregard the complexity warnings (too many statements, or too many local variables) where you  didn't generate the complexity, though refactoring out some complexity is nice to do while you're in there.

I picked the landscape rules based on where I'd like to the repo to go towards, we could have a committer conversation if people disagree with some of these rules.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Ahhh, I'm dumb. I thought putting a file in the tests folder was enough to run the tests -- but I think it needs to be imported as well. Making that adjustment now, which should satisfy coveralls, because the method is definitely well tested!

                Coveralls and landscape are great, it just takes a bit of getting used to. Please take a look at the landscape link that says "14 new problems were found " and fix the things you think are reasonable.

I personally like PEP8 and would like to enforce it. Maybe not all PRs need to be 100% perfect but we should make sure that they leave the repo in a better state.
