                </div><div><b>description:</b> The command line parsing in zookeepermain is very basic.We should use some kind of cli parsing (commons-cli?) or something else that is standard and improve our command line parsing. This will remove the scattered code that we have in zookeepermain and we will have much better command line parsing.

                not a blocker for 3.2, moving to 3.3
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> A attached a patch with my work to refactor the CLI to use commons-cli.
Every command has now its own java-class, with CliCommand.java as base.class.

The options for some commands were changed to match the option usage in commons-cli.
But to maintain the compatibility the old argument style for these commands was preserved. This could be removed in a future revision.

The commands with changed options are:
get [-s] [-w] path, old version was: get path [watch]
ls [-w] path, old version was ls path [watch]
ls2 [-w] path, old version was ls2 path [watch]
stat [-w] path, old version was stat path [watch]

Please have a look.

{noformat}

does this mean the new client is 100% backward compatible with the old client or not? If not we should mark this as an incompatible change (there's a flag for this) and document in the "release notes".

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks for reviewing it.
I added backward compatibility to all the commands.
So it should be 100% backward compatible, but a warning is printed.

                Sweet. Thanks Hartmut. I've committed this to trunk (3.5.0) and noted a few issues I found in the release notes.
