                </div><div><b>description:</b> Currently the Dockerfile specifies the Tomcat version down to the patch level (TOMCAT_VERSION=8.0.20), which isn't ideal.
Tomcat 8.0.20 has by now several major security issues which are fixed in the lasted release 8.0.47.

I checked out the current github source and build / (shortly) tested successful with 8.0 and 8 as version tag. Which leads Docker to pull the current 8.0.47 respectively 8.5.23 tomcat image.

Considering the end of life for Apache Tomcat 8.0.x in June 2018 I would suggest changing the Tomcat version directly to the major 8 branch.
(furthermore an automated build up-to-date official guac image with an current tomcat would be good for everyone.)

The version definitely needs to be updated, and will continually need to be updated, however I'm wary of pointing to just the major version tag, rather than a specific known-good version, as this has bit us in the past. At an earlier point in the pre-Apache days, the tag was a generic major release tag (at the time, version 7), but a bug which broke WebSocket was released in Tomcat which resulted in the Guacamole Docker image entirely not working:

https://github.com/glyptodon/guacamole-docker/commit/1df41e684199d5856d84edd445cbbb1e697658dd

In addition to updating the version number, it would probably be better to (somehow) parameterize the Dockerfile such that the Tomcat version can be changed and the image rebuilt, if necessary.

It could be useful, yes, however I think ASF release policy does not allow such builds to be intentionally aimed at general consumption. Convenience binaries for an otherwise entirely source release are allowed, but would need to be built from the released source as part of the release process:

http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#compiled-packages

Continuous, automated builds are technically doable, but would need to be made available only to those that are explicitly made aware that they are not release binaries and are meant for development use only, which is not the intent here:

http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#host-rc

If the concern is that the Docker images may become frequently out of date due to updates to Tomcat, then the only solutions are for us to be sure to release more frequently (being sure to update the Tomcat version whenever doing so does not break things), or for the packaging of the Docker image itself to move downstream.
