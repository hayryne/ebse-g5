Note: it provides a junit-vintage module so we should be able to migrate stuffs easily (!)

Most users should now be able to write JUnit 5 tests using the modules created in CAMEL-13342.
Concerning the migration of camel own tests to JUnit5, the last blocker is that migrating flaky tests to JUnit 5 is not handled until mavensurefire 3 has been released or until open discussions in [the junit team|https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1558] has converged.

                One thing to consider:

The maven surefire rerunFailingTestsCount option currently does not work with JUnit 5. Therefore the build will become a lot more unstable. There is an open issue to add the option to rerun failing tests to JUnit 5 (https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1558) where this problem is discussed.

                one thing is internally in camel - but it would be good to offer an alternative to CamelSpringRunner to consumers of the framework - so that they could move to junit5.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Wouldn't it be sensible to have two separate issues:

1) Upgrade Camel unit tests to JUnit 5

2) Provide base test classes for consumers of the framework using JUnit 5 (e.g. {{CamelSpringRunner}} and {{CamelSpringBootRunner}}).

                Hi I just wanted to see if there was any additional info on this. Weâ€™re heavy JUnit 5/Spring Boot users and it would nice to be consistent with our applications to be able to use JUnit 5 throughout.

                Hi [~edeandrea], this issue should affect only Camel and Camel tests. I think you can use the support for testing in {{camel-test}} regardless or by using JUnit Vintage. If you encounter any issues please report them and we'll try to address them.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi [~zregvart] maybe I got to this issue by mistake - it was [linked to from StackOverflow by Sam Brannen|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48292929/junit-5-with-cameltestsupport].

I understand I can use JUnit Vintage and still write my tests using JUnit 4. My question was specifically around being able to write my Camel tests in JUnit 5 using all the goodies that it brings (i.e. parameterized tests, etc) using the
{noformat}
@ExtendWith{noformat}
annotation vs
{noformat}
@RunWith(CamelSpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class){noformat}
                </div><div><b>label:</b> test
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Its a significant investment to upgrade all of Camel's tests to junit 5 and also offer junit 5 test components. Its not on the radar on the short term, as we are focusing on at this moment more important stuff with the core of Camel for Camel 3.

We are surely love contributions and help. For example #1 help to build junit5 copies of the various camel-test modules, so we can  have as side by side for junit4 vs junit5 test kits (eg camel-test and camel-test5 etc). 

And #2 then eventually migrate Camel's own unit tests (but less prioritiy as have end user junit5 test modules).

And we also encourage users to use the JIRA voting system for tickets.

                Thanks [~davsclaus] for the info. Would it make sense for me to open a separate ticket for providing a junit5 test kit?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah sure and link it to this ticket
              </div></li><li><div>
                I added CAMEL-13342
              </div></li><li><div>
                I participate GSoC. If there is no one take this project, I can take it. I have experience with JUnit 5.Thanks :)&nbsp;Please mentor/ guide me through this project?&nbsp;
