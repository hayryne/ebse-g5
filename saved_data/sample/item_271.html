                Jeremy Hanna was interested in how this will look. Its easy.

{code}
public SocailTraversal&lt;S,E&gt; extends DefaultTraversal&lt;S,E&gt; {

  private final GraphTraversal&lt;S,E&gt; rawTraversal = new DefaultGraphTraversal&lt;S,E&gt;();

  public SocialTraversal&lt;S,Vertex&gt; know(final String personName) {
    this.rawTraversal.out("knows").hasLabel("person").has("name",personName);
    return this;
  }

  public SocialTraversal&lt;S,Vertex&gt; olderThan(final String personName) {
    this.rawTraversal.filter(as("xx").V().has("name",personName").values("age").where(lt("xx")));
   return this;
  }

 public SocialTraversal&lt;S,Vertex&gt; people() {
    this.rawTraversal.V().hasLabel("person");
    return this;
 }

 public SocialTraversal&lt;S,String&gt; name() {
   this.rawTraversal.values("name");
   return this;
 }
 
 public SocialTraversal&lt;S,E&gt; who() {
   return this;
  }

  public SocialTraversal&lt;S,E&gt; thatAre() {
   return this;
  }
  ......
}
{code}

They will then need a {{TraversalSource}} implementation which we will have a {{DefaultTraversalSource}} to make things easy. And finally, in action:

{code}
social = graph.traversal(SocialTraversal.class)
social.people().who().know("stephen").thatAre().olderThan("daniel").name()
{code}

TADA!

                This is now possible with the merging of TINKERPOP-971.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Perhaps we need a tutorial written on this topic at this point as it sounds like the pattern is decided. I'm going to switch the type on this issue to "documentation" and here's some recent discussion on the mailing list for ways DSLs can be implemented:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/FO3bcXHWTrg/6H64dHrUFgAJ
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Unless I'm missing something, this approach doesn't enable extension of an existing traversal DSL. For my use case, and I imagine many others' as well, this ability is critical.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It occurs to me that I'm not sure how DSLs will work with the remoting API/GLVs. not sure if anyone has any thoughts on that.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Since all GLVs will probably use some form of code generator which will most likely be based on gremlin-java, I think the best option here would be to make those generators flexible enough so that they can be used with a DSL defined by users.
When we define a common interface for the GLV generators, then users can simply call the generators on their own DSL and get the DSL in all GLVs.
Maybe the interfaces could look something like this:
# {{GraphTraversalGenerator}}: Takes a {{GraphTraversal}} class or a class derived from that as its input
# {{GraphTraversalSourceGenerator}}: Takes a {{GraphTraversalSource}} class or a class derived from that as its input
# {{EnumGenerator}}: Takes an enum class as its input (like {{T}})
# {{PredicateGenerator}}: Takes a predicate class as its input (like {{P}})

This would probably require some modifications to the existing GLV generators so that they implement those interfaces and also to make them flexible enough to work with a DSL (e.g. the generator should not only expect a {{GraphTraversal}} as the return type for steps but also a type that derives from that).

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> That is a good idea [~Florian Hockmann]. That would definitely make it easier to "pump out" GLVs and keep them all unified and easier to maintain.

    TINKERPOP-786 Gremlin DSL Support

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-786
    
    This pull request provides tools, documentation, tests and examples for how to develop DSLs for both Java/Groovy as well Python. Note the addition of the new `gremlin-archetype-dsl` module which demonstrates how the DSL system works with Java/Groovy and see `test_dsl.py` for the recommended method for python.
    
    Builds with `docker/build.sh -t -i -n`

    Slick! It's indeed much easier than I thought.

                This looks quite similar to the approach we have been using internally, almost a drop in replacement; very excited to see it, thanks Stephen. I'll take a look and see if it works for our use case; now that there's some existing code here we may be able to contribute some improvements if necessary.
