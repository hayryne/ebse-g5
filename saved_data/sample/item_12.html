                yep, I thought you meant to refact the mothod name rather the method body. 
Now when shortening the method, the error really goes away.

                Hi Xueqiang,

I just tried to apply camel-20090816.patch against the latest trunk and it failed. I noticed a couple of errors like duplicated diffs, etc in the patch file. How did you generate it?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @ Xueqiang

Can you take a look the unit tests in the org.apache.camel.web.groovy which are commented out ?
There are about 10 tests which do work now.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Ah, I see there was some checkstyle fixes made today to camel-web. Xueqiang, could you update to the latest trunk and re-submit your patch?

Cheers,
Jon
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think the method is just too long. Factor it out into several smaller methods to see if that helps. I did a quick test where I basically commented out half of the method and it passed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Oh, I will check it again and re-submit it some later.

Could you build with checkstyle and make sure the patches are compliant with checkstyle. See more here to run it:
http://camel.apache.org/building.html

As it causes us to have to manually fix it later. And this weekend Hadrian had to use quite some time on this that causes further delay on a 2.0 release.

Glad to see you got rid of that temp context! :)
              </div></li><li><div>
                Fixed the test bug and add some dsl support.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Xueqiang is looking into this as part of the groovy web console addition.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I read the unit tests and will fix some of them asap. But not all of them can be fixed at current version. A page listing the unsupported features on web console is created: [Unsupported Groovy DSL Features on Web Console].
              </div></li><li><div>
                Nice work Xueqiang. A few comments before I will commit this to trunk:

- Each time the route is edited, we get a new route id (route1, route2, route3, etc...). The original route id should be preserved.
- We probably won't be able to support rendering closure expressions nicely unfortunately... a closure could be arbitrary Groovy code, which makes things very difficult. You may want to move on with the project and keep CAMEL-1769 as a known bug for now. Of course, you are MORE than welcome to give it a bit more thought/come up with a solution :) 
- Just as an FYI we'll eventually want to move the text renderer API to camel-core and the Groovy renderer to camel-groovy - its fine for now since this is still experimental. Maybe when the project is closer to completion later this summer you can do this work.
- You should start adding in some unit tests for the renderer so we can keep track of what we know is rendering correctly.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Now the GroovyRenderer can support most of the route definition on page: http://camel.apache.org/enterprise-integration-patterns.html. 
But there are some bug for the ExpressionDefinition process. https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1769 is created to report the bug on ExpressionDefinition render.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Xueqiang,

Just took a look at your latest patch; liking the create route feature! Not sure about the view all routes though... looks bit messy IMHO and I doubt folks would always want to view their routes as only Groovy... maybe disable that screen for now? I also had a few test failures after applying the patch

{code}
Failed tests: 
  testTracePerRotueManual(org.apache.camel.web.groovy.TracingDSLTest)
  testInterceptFromUriRegex(org.apache.camel.web.groovy.InterceptFromDSLTest)
  testInterceptFromUriSimpleLog(org.apache.camel.web.groovy.InterceptFromDSLTest)
  testInterceptFromUriWildcard(org.apache.camel.web.groovy.InterceptFromDSLTest)

Tests run: 162, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 14
{code}
              </div></li><li><div>
                Also, instead of duplicating the dataformat types (and loadbalancer types too), you should be able to grab the short names through the JAXB metadata. Like so

{code}
dataFormat.getClass().getAnnotation(XmlRootElement.class).name()
{code}
              </div></li><li><div>
                Quickly trying this new code drop out before leaving for the day :) In the GroovyRendererTest I noticed pretty much all routes defined in the supported list get rendered like "from("direct:start",).to("mock:result")". Example output:

{code}
dsl: from("direct:start").unmarshal().serialization().to("mock:result")
after rendered: 
import org.apache.camel.language.groovy.GroovyRouteBuilder;
class GroovyRoute extends GroovyRouteBuilder {
void configure() {
from("direct:start",).to("mock:result")
}
}
{code}

Not sure if this is a bug in the renderer or the test case. Care to fix that up?

Also unit tests typically contain assertions on the output of a piece of code to make sure its operating correctly. In your case the test should be asserting that the output of the renderer is correct. Currently we have to verify this by looking at the output.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Add a bundle of test cases to demonstrate which DSL have been supported by groovy renderer.
Tomorrow will start the user guide of it.

                Xueqiang,

I just committed your latest patch in rev 795901. Good work! Glad to see you are making progress supporting the various DSL methods. The hardcodings (like loadbalancer, byte[], etc..) still kinda worry me but are acceptable I guess since we have tests now that will let us know when things need to be updated.

Don't have any more comments at the moment. I suggest continuing with your work of supporting more of the DSL methods this week.
              </div></li><li><div>
                add setHeader, setProperty, removeHeader, removeProperty DSLs support.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Jonathan I assume you got it covered to get the patches into the codebase?

                Looks great Xueqiang. Keep up the good work.

I've committed your patch here http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=796685&amp;view=rev

Cheers,
Jon
