So this ticket is about adding the dist tag to RPMs. We can add a similar thing to DEB once we support multiple debian/ubuntu GNU/Linux distributions.

                Here is a patch
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> +1  Note this will not work on openSuse/SLES without modifying or adding a macro somewhere for rpm.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                correct. Then, let's make it work everywhere first. Let me update the patch with something else
              </div></li><li><div>
                +1
              </div></li><li><div>
                Actually, let's get this in now for the release. So at least it can help on some of the platforms.
We can always fix it later on for openSUSE/SLES
