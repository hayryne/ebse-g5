                @jdeppe-pivotal @kohlmu-pivotal can you two take a look.  We can't seem to add reviewers via github.

                &gt; The code is somehow lacking in logging... Makes it REALLY hard to understand what is happening on the server WITHOUT stepping through code. Could we please add logging to `RenameExecutor`. Things like logger.info, logger.debug, logger.warn and logger.error are incredibly useful.

@kohlmu-pivotal, the redis commands all execute within this `ExecutionHandlerContext`.  The `ExecutionHandlerContext` logs all the inputs and then will also log any exceptions thrown.  I think that should make the `RenameExecutor` pretty debuggable

                Please don't use single (or double) character variable names
              </div></li><li><div>
                what is `pwd`?
              </div></li><li><div>
                `ch` is bad parameter/variable name. Please correct to something a little more descriptive. Like `channel`... makes it easier to read when one gets past 15 lines of code where it was initially defined
