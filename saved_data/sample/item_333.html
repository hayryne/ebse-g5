   * Add an ozoneAcl to list of existing Acl set.

                 If existing acl has same bitset as passed acl bitset, remove that
 acl from the list
              </div></li><li><div>
                 When we are removing subset of rights from existing acl.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 This happens when the acl bitset asked to remove is not set for
 matched name and type.
 Like a case we have 444 permission, 333 is asked to removed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 We need to do "or" before comparision because think of a case like
 existing acl is 777 and newly added acl is 444, we have already
 that acl set. In this case if we do direct check they will not
 be equal, but if we do or and then check, we shall know it
 has acl's already set or not.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 We have some matching. Remove them.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Case 1: When we are adding more rights to existing user/group.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Remove old acl and add new acl.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Case 2: When a completely new acl is added.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 As by default create will add some default acls in RpcClient.

Note: As this is an incremental change, it is expected to have failures related to file, key ops test cases. Will fix this later through subsequent sub-tasks.

Verified using TestOMDirectoryCreateResponse.java and TestOzonePrefixTable.java unit test cases.
Note: As this is an incremental change, it is expected to have failures related to file, key ops test cases. Will fix this later through subsequent sub-tasks.

                Thanks @bharatviswa504 @linyiqun  for the reviews. I am sorry for multiple PRs. I have created new PR https://github.com/apache/hadoop-ozone/pull/1404 now. Basically, the idea is to create new set of classes V1 for easy migration of this feature branch with rolling upgrade. Also, I have created new table Directory_Table instead of Prefix Table. This is to simplifies the caching logic later.

Please review this PR and thanks for your patience!

                This gets value from DB, as the prefix table does not use table cache, it stores entries in prefixTree.
I think here we need to expose an API in prefixManagerImpl to get(String Path) and use that here.
And also a question, do we need hold prefix lock here? 

And also got a question here.
1. When prefixAcl is removed, we remove paths. That can cause the problem here right, the paths which are created by mkdir now can be removed by removePrefixAcl.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The Comment needs to be updated, here we don't pass volume, bucket and key. The same problem in getOzoneLeafNodeKey method.
              </div></li><li><div>
                As we store the dir in prefix table now, we need to acquire PREFIX_LOCK instead of BUCKET_LOCK.
`
acquiredLock = omMetadataManager.getLock().acquireWriteLock(BUCKET_LOCK,
 volumeName, bucketName);
`
              </div></li><li><div>
                Can you add an additionally test cases for creating one file and verified current entries in KeyTable? Now the new file key would be like objId/fileName rather than /volume/bucket/keyName.

                Will fix it in new commit.

                Agreed, will fix it in new commit
              </div></li><li><div>
                #verifyPrefixKey() function is doing the same by fetching entries using "omMgr.getPrefixTable().get(dbKey);" call.
Are you suggesting something different from this verification check?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Agreed, will fix it new commit
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Very good point. Will improve this logic.

                Very good point. Based on the upgrade path discussion, the plan is to introduce new directory table. In that case, all the dir ops will be under BUKCET_LOCK. Will update the patch soon with that changes.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @rakeshadr , actually I mean we need to add logic to verify new entry on key table as well in ut. Current unit test only check the dir entry in prefix table.

My suggestion is to write a new key file here.
Then we can check the new format entry in key table.

Key table format before:
KeyName:
/vol1/buck1/a/b/c/d/file1

Now will be like this:
1028/file1
