This is bad from performance perspective. 

The task is to support peer field deserialization by looking it up in a marshalled byte array and unmarshalling it from a concrete offset with OptimizedMarshaller later.

                One of the users pointed out an issue with indexing and custom class loading (I think the issue exists for peer-deployment as well): http://apache-ignite-users.70518.x6.nabble.com/Dynamic-classes-in-IgniteCache-td705.html

I believe it should be fixed in the scope of this ticket.

                My original design with adding methods on the Marshaller interface does not really work well because in order to truly plug into cache mechanics the cache object manager (introduced) should be pluggable.
Since we still want to configure a marshaller per cache, I suggest using an annotation attached to a marshaller indicating that another cache object manager should be used for a cache:
{code}
@CacheObjectManager(PortableObjectManager.class)
public class PortableMarshaller extends MarshallerAdapter {
}
{code}
              </div></li><li><div>
                The changes were merged to ignite-1282 branch,
              </div></li><li><div>
                This particular feature was dropped in favor of portable marshaller. Changes related to the fix were merged to ignite-1282 branch.
