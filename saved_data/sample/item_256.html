                </div><div><b>description:</b> From David Lerman:
"
I'm running into errors where CombinedHiveInputFormat is combining data from
two different tables which is causing problems because the tables have
different input formats.

It looks like the problem is in
org.apache.hadoop.hive.shims.Hadoop20Shims.getInputPathsShim.  It calls
CombineFileInputFormat.getInputPaths which returns the list of input paths
and then chops off the first 5 characters to remove file: from the
beginning, but the return value I'm getting from getInputPaths is actually
hdfs://domain/path.  So then when it creates the pools using these paths,
none of the input paths match the pools (since they're just the file path
which protocol or domain).
"

We should use Path.getPath() to get the path part of an URI instead of just chopping off 5 chars.

                +1. Looks good. Will commit if tests pass.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> This patch appears to affect other functionality.  Without the patch, "insert overwrite directory 'out' select ... from ..." yields 1 MR job, but with the patch, it yields 2 MR jobs.  At first glance, it looks like the second job in the insert overwrite plan is a conditional operation where it either does an HDFS move to move the data from the temp output directory to its final destination, or runs a MR job to copy the data (maybe if it needs to copy across clusters?).  Before the patch, it just does the HDFS copy, but after it, it does the MR copy.  Maybe the paths its comparing to determine which task to run are getting screwed up by the patch?

Steps to reproduce:

Using Cloudera's Hadoop 0.20.1+152 (since the CombineFile functionality doesn't work in 0.20.1 without the extra patches):

* Create a data file twolines.dat containing:

key1^Avalue1
key2^Avalue2

* Create a table with two partitions each containing that data:

CREATE TABLE fourlinestest(KEY STRING, VALUE STRING) PARTITIONED BY (part int) STORED AS TEXTFILE;
load data local inpath 'twolines.dat' into table fourlinestest partition (part=1);
load data local inpath 'twolines.dat' into table fourlinestest partition (part=2);

* Using Hive r888452 (before this patch was applied):

set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat;
insert overwrite directory 'out' select key from fourlinestest;

--&gt; The log shows that that the pools are getting created with corrupt paths (which was the bug that was fixed), but the job runs successfully with 1 MR job:

Total MapReduce jobs = 2
Launching Job 1 out of 2
Number of reduce tasks is set to 0 since there's no reduce operator

Launching Job 2 out of 2
Moving data to: hdfs://REMOVED/561636114/10000

4 Rows loaded to out
OK

* Apply the patch, rebuild, and rerun

patch -p0 &lt; hive.1001.1.patch
ant package
bin/hive
set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.CombineHiveInputFormat;
insert overwrite directory 'out' select key from fourlinestest;

--&gt; This time the second job actually runs a MR job (which then fails because of HIVE-1006).

                Hi Dave,

How many mappers in the map-reduce job before applying this patch?  It is strange that the merge job was not running. The merge job is started according to average result file size produced by the first job, and the merge job always uses a map-reduce job.

And also discussed with Namit, we may need to add another parameter "number of files" to determine whether to start the merge job or not (this will be a different issue).
              </div></li><li><div>
                Okay, that makes sense then.  Without the patch, the two input pools have corrupt paths so the input files don't match either pool and get processed together in one pool of non-matching paths.  This yields one split and one mapper, so the merge step doesn't run (since there's only one output file).

With the patch, the pools get created correctly, so the two files are processed in separate pools, which yields two splits and two mappers, so the merge step runs.

Thanks for the help.
