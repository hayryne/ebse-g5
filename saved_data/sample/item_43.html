                Just curious - does the `v` add anything in particular?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Let's name the classes and files consistently so they are easy to find.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> We had discussed using a proto definition like

```
message WellKnownUrns {
  string global_windows = 1 [default = "urn:beam:windowfn:global_windows:0.1"]
  ...
}
```

But I guess this is proto 2 only. For normal proto use, I agree with this change, but it is too bad we don't have that hack available. Any other ideas? A data file seems mostly pointless because whatever you look up the URN by is effectively just another unique name anyhow (it would probably prevent _some_ errors).

Not that I think there is a huge danger of these getting out of sync, since they can never change once they are really used. But it would be nice for new SDKs, etc.

                FWIW the `urn:` at the beginning is the URI scheme that makes it a URN. The official syntax is `"urn:"` _Namespace_ `:` _Namespace-specific format_

(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141#section-2)

 I agree the scheme is mostly pointless but wanted to just note the departure.
              </div></li><li><div>
                (in particular, top level schemes and the remainder of the URI have exactly the same relationship as URN namespaces and the NSS, as far as I can tell)
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm open for suggestions (haven't come up with names that feel right yet).

                Makes it clearer that this number is a version field.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I didn't know urns were an official thing with a spec... We can prefix everything with urn: if you want. 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> We could have a script that goes through the proto file (or something else) and pulls the name out and generates a .java, .py, .go, ... file of constants. Perhaps overkill though. Ideally this'd be co-located with the semantic definition of the urn as well, if needed.

                One design decision on the Java side (which I don't feel wedded to) is that URNs and payloads are entirely divorced from their Java native classes. I had imagined adding `PTransform.getUrn()` but instead we have a registrar from Java class to URN and payload which lives entirely outside the core SDK to keep proto off the API surface.

I don't entirely understand the ramifications of the Python SDK making both of these decisions separately. (PTransform having their URN, proto messages being right there too). I'd love your thoughts on it sometime, and whether we can easily make Java more natural.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> There are certainly pros and cons to each, but we should be consistent. Certainly going from the urn to object requires some kind of registration (even if the other way around can be handled by polymorphism). 

Probably wouldn't hurt to put together a doc detailing these design choices, which wouldn't have to all be resolved now (but before the Runner/Fn Api is public we would make sure all SDKs are consistent).

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I generally think that two-way translation is better via separate registered translators than dynamic dispatch. So that is where the design comes from. But actually, we don't _really_ do it, for a specific reason. When we are parsing a proto that has URN "beam:transforms:pardo" we don't try to make a Java `ParDo` object because the types wouldn't work out, etc. Instead all transforms just become `RawPTransform` that can vend its URN and language-agnostic bits of the payload.

I am currently fleshing out the kinds of access runners will need and will then add all this to the runner guide.

Just notes, nothing particularly needed here.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> The PipelineRunner API from the SDK is not ideal for the Beam technical vision.

It has technical limitations:

 - The user's DAG (even including library expansions) is never explicitly represented, so it cannot be analyzed except incrementally, and cannot necessarily be reconstructed (for example, to display it!).
 - The flattened DAG of just primitive transforms isn't well-suited for display or transform override.
 - The TransformHierarchy isn't well-suited for optimizations.
 - The user must realistically pre-commit to a runner, and its configuration (batch vs streaming) prior to graph construction, since the runner will be modifying the graph as it is built.
 - It is fairly language- and SDK-specific.

It has usability issues (these are not from intuition, but derived from actual cases of failure to use according to the design)

 - The interleaving of apply() methods in PTransform/Pipeline/PipelineRunner is confusing.
 - The TransformHierarchy, accessible only via visitor traversals, is cumbersome.
 - The staging of construction-time vs run-time is not always obvious.

These are just examples. This ticket tracks designing, coming to consensus, and building an API that more simply and directly supports the technical vision.

    [BEAM-115] Move expansion of Window.Bound into particular runners

    As per the [Runner API design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bao-5B6uBuf-kwH1meenAuXXS0c9cBQ1B2J59I3FiyI/edit?usp=sharing) this makes `Window.into` very explicitly a primitive, and moves the subsidiary primitives to top level classes in the `util/` (aka miscellaneous) directory, eventually to move to some appropriate final location for "runner utilities" or to be removed entirely.

    Move expansion of Window.Bound into particular runners
    
    In the Beam model, windowing is a primitive concept. The expansion provided
    by the SDK is not implementable except via access to privileged methods
    not intended for Beam pipeline authors.
    
    This change is a precursor to eliminating these privileged entirely.

    [BEAM-115] Remove extraneous type parameter from Trigger, etc

    This has no user-visible effect unless they have to declare a variable of type `Trigger`, etc, since we use factory methods where extra type parameters are just a warning. For this PR, I have deliberately _not_ cleared out such parameters from examples or integration tests, to be sure that nothing is broken. I will follow up with that.
    
    This is in service of the runner API in that triggers move towards a cross-language cross-runner syntax and clearing out this type parameter makes it easier to proceed with further refactors.

    This is to easily support wholesale replacement of composite transforms. The Flink and Spark runner already achieve this by tracking whether they are in a region of the Pipeline that should be ignored. I ported over the Spark runner to simplify it, but not the Flink runner, to get this PR out for feedback.

    [BEAM-115] WIP: JSON Schema definition of pipeline

    This is a json-schema sketch of the concrete schema from the [Pipeline Runner API proposal document](https://s.apache.org/beam-runner-api). Because our [serialization tech discussion](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/beam-dev/201606.mbox/%3CCAN_Ypr2ZPQG3OgPWu==kF-zztG06k0v5i0AY3DABCHJyvEr9pA@mail.gmail.com%3E) seemed to favor JSON on the front end and Proto on the backend, I made this quick port. The original Avro IDL definition is also on [a branch with a test](https://github.com/kennknowles/incubator-beam/blob/pipeline-model/model/pipeline/src/main/avro/org/apache/beam/model/pipeline/pipeline.avdl).
    
    Notes &amp; Caveats:
     - I did not try to flesh out any more details; this was a straight port. There's plenty to add, but a PR seems like a place that will attract a desired kind of concrete discussion even in the current state.
     - Typing this makes my hands hurt. Luckily, it should change exceedingly rarely. There are many libraries that can generate json-schema in various ways, including Jackson itself, but I'm not so sure any of them are applicable.
     - Reading this makes my eyes hurt. This is a real problem. We need a readable spec, not just a test suite for validation.
     - I am not so sure that [the schema library](https://github.com/daveclayton/json-schema-validator) I've used to build my smoke test is a good long term choice. I chose it because it was Jackson-based.
     - I've left comments in the JSON even though that is frowned upon, and taken advantage of Jackson's feature to allow them. They can also go into `"description"` fields.
     - Perhaps we could write YAML and convert to json-schema with no loss of precision?
    
    Feel free to leave comments here about the schema or meta issues of e.g. where the schema should live and what libraries we might want to use.

    This removes PInput and POutput from the API Surface of
    TransformHierarchy.Node, at least directly, and forces Pipeline Visitors
    to access only the expanded version of the output.
    
    This is part of the move towards the runner-agnostic representation of a

    [BEAM-115] WIP: JSON Schema definition of pipeline

    This is a json-schema sketch of the concrete schema from the [Pipeline Runner API proposal document](https://s.apache.org/beam-runner-api). Because our [serialization tech discussion](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/beam-dev/201606.mbox/%3CCAN_Ypr2ZPQG3OgPWu==kF-zztG06k0v5i0AY3DABCHJyvEr9pA@mail.gmail.com%3E) seemed to favor JSON on the front end and Proto on the backend, I made this quick port. The original Avro IDL definition is also on [a branch with a test](https://github.com/kennknowles/incubator-beam/blob/pipeline-model/model/pipeline/src/main/avro/org/apache/beam/model/pipeline/pipeline.avdl).
    
    Notes &amp; Caveats:
    - I did not try to flesh out any more details; this was a straight port. There's plenty to add, but a PR seems like a place that will attract a desired kind of concrete discussion even in the current state.
    - Typing this makes my hands hurt. Luckily, it should change exceedingly rarely. There are many libraries that can generate json-schema in various ways, including Jackson itself, but I'm not so sure any of them are applicable.
    - Reading this makes my eyes hurt. This is a real problem. We need a readable spec, not just a test suite for validation.
    - I am not so sure that [the schema library](https://github.com/daveclayton/json-schema-validator) I've used to build my smoke test is a good long term choice. I chose it because it was Jackson-based.
    - I've left comments in the JSON even though that is frowned upon, and taken advantage of Jackson's feature to allow them. They can also go into `"description"` fields.
    - Perhaps we could write YAML and convert to json-schema with no loss of precision?
    
    Feel free to leave comments here about the schema or meta issues of e.g. where the schema should live and what libraries we might want to use.

    These are the protocol buffers definitions corresponding to the Avro schema proposed in https://s.apache.org/beam-runner-api.
    
    Differences from the schema there:
    
     - Graph structure is decoupled from what data annotations the nodes
     - Adopted names from the Fn API's proto for things that overlap
     - Added explicit URNs and payloads for primitives
     - Added outline of state and timers
     - Added Environment URLs
    
    I would like to merge this and separately port the Fn API to use shared structures as appropriate, since that may involve more extensive coding work.
    
    Unlike #662, this is _not_ a WIP just for discussion. This is intended for immediate use as the serialization format for various pieces of the pipeline to unblock work on the Fn API.

    This includes the entirety of #2000, which unified `FunctionSpec`. Feel free to review that first or, if you prefer, review just this since the diff is small.
    
    The unification here was uninteresting on top of #2000. Summary of changes:
    
     - Moved a coder's local id out of the `Coder` itself and into the key of a map in `ProcessBundleDescriptor`. Philosophically, the id is an essential aspect of `ProcessBundleDescriptor` (or `Pipeline`) but not not an essential aspect of a coder.  Pragmatically, this allows the Runner API and the Fn API to key the map on different types (`string` and `int64` respectively). Prospectively, it makes it easy to construct instances of the message that are "just values" without any id, which is aesthetically pleasing and more flexible to more uses.
     - Inlined the `SdkFunctionSpec` in `Coder` in the Runner API. Having it by reference introduces a needless sharing of key type and adds needless overhead, since coders are already stored by reference, as are environments.

    Some aspects of this PR are sort of hacks, but the kind that might be forgiven in order to make rapid progress. I am opening the PR for comment anyhow, but there are  few changes that I might now make underneath this PR:
    
    1. Move Java SDK `ClosingBehavior` to top level and rename. Incidentally related to [BEAM-210](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-210) only because that is another reason this should just be a top-level concept. Not sure there's much benefit to putting public enums inside other misc classes when there's no real natural home for them.
    2. Move Java SDK `AccumulationMode` to top level and put its to/from proto there. In particular, it should also come out of `util`.
    3. Maybe actually try to move from `OutputTimeFn` to a Java SDK `OutputTime` prior to this PR. But actually converting this to proto, then converting the runners to use that will make the latter migration easier. Some cruft is introduced in the meantime, though.
    4. If `WindowingStrategy` is going to continue to be a thing that is prominent all over our public SDK surface and in the runner API whether it really belongs in `util`.
    
    And I'll want to flesh out the list of test cases. Given how generic the logic is, I don't expect many surprises.

    Just shares `Coder`. Its a hack - it is really crufty to have side-by-side int and string registries. But coders need to be by-reference. Options, off the top of my head:
    
    1. Make everything keyed on int64 (distasteful for debugging, but not horrid).
    2. Make everything keyed on string.
    3. Make Fn API and harness really embrace separate registries by type.
    4. Write 3 lines of conversion code, since sharing this one trivial proto has only unclear benefit, while avoiding a hard dependency is almost always a win.

    This gets rid of the excessive generic design of `GraphNode` and restores it to the original design wherein each node is a `PTransform`. I have also merged the `bytes` of the SDK-specific data and the `Any` that is SDK-independent data, since as has been pointed out we won't need both.

    Inline PTransform to GraphNode, removing generic design
    
    The GraphNode structure was made more generic to allow the Runner API
    and Fn API to share the graph data structure while carrying distinct
    payloads on nodes and edges. It seems that the Runner API was already
    sufficiently flexible for the Fn API to use its existing payload
    design.

    The awkward bit is that a combining `StateSpec` is statically typed to take a `CombineFn`. So when we get around to issuing Fn State API requests, we'll need to work around that.

    Add case dispatch to StateSpec
    
    This is different than a StateBinder: for a binder, the id is needed and
    the StateSpec controls the return type. For case dispatch, the
    dispatcher controls the type and it should just be reading the spec,
    which does not require the id. Eventually, StateBinder could be removed
    in favor of StateSpec.Cases&lt;Function&lt;String, StateT&gt;&gt;.
