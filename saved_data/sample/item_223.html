                </div><div><b>description:</b> This is a patch for the old issue 236403 with the same name, see [https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=236403]&nbsp;.

Since about NetBeans 7.4, the Java editor's Javadoc popup has been rendered with an all-monospace font. There have also been various complaints about the Javadoc's font size (which the monospace font "fixed" because the monospace font looks larger at the same point size).

The attached patch&nbsp;makes the Javadoc popup once again use a non-monospace font (as in generated Javadoc HTML), while at the same time increasing the font size to match the editor's own zoom level. See the attached screenshot.

                I just redid the patch as a github pull request. I also verified that there are no problems under the Darcula L&amp;F (avoiding reintroducing bug [231808|https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=231808]).
