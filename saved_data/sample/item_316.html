                 Since the core descriptor is removed when a core is unloaded, it should never be anywhere when a core is created.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Check bookkeeping by removing and creating the core again, making sure
 we didn't leave the record of trying to create this core around.
 NOTE: unloading the core closes it too.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Let's add a little stress in here by using the same core name each
 time around. The final unload in the loop should delete the core and
 allow the next time around to succeed.
 This also checks the bookkeeping in CoreContainer.create
 that prevents muliple simulatneous creations,
 currently "inFlightCreations"

                 We can't guarantee that which thread failed, so go find it

                 This call should fail with a different error because the core was
 created successfully.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 only one of these should succeed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                 Try this a few times to increase the chances of failure.
