                @gtully ping. I will add docs in another PR later. 

Like wise will sort OpenWire to be able to set client side after(if) this gets merged. Wanted to sort supporting this on core (client and config) as first step, as a single change, to avoid it becoming a mammoth PR.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @michaelandrepearce to make the feature work is trivial in queueimpl; to make it dynamic is a lot of code.
I would have been shooting for an address setting and pulling that value in queueImpl on creation. An all or nothing approach.
But what you have is very comprehensive :-) I just wonder if there really is a need to have the consumer create an lvq or exclusive queue. If there is, then this nails it.
For an existing openwire client the value can come from a consumer info or from a destination parameter but mostly it is the effect that is needed, not the fact that it is dynamic, ie: Because it effects every consumer having a single consumer control it is a bit imbalanced and not typical I think.

                @gtully yes there is a use case for the client part here in our org, we have dynamic non durable shared consumers, where one pair of shared consumers needs it to be exclusive, and the other pair don't, thus why. and why i added that in the test case.

I'd rather do this fully, than partial and have to come back to it, thus it being comprehensive.

@mtaylor or anyone(PMC) with access, can someone look at the build system, ive tried 10 times, and keep getting build fails with the below which seems infra related.

                @michaelandrepearce Hey Michael.  I think this was a temp failure.  There is an Artemis PR job running now that doesn't show the git clone problem.  The CI is shared and there are a bunch of jobs queued so we might have to wait a while to run again.

                @gtully you happy if this is merged (I can do or I can’t leave for you) or you still reviewing? Just waiting on this before I continue with the other bits as mentioned

                @franz1981 seems no objections (i addressed gtully's comment on rationalising fyi) , you still ok to merge?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @michaelandrepearce i don't have the chance to merge it yet :(
Anyway it seems that there aren't any objections so I suppose it is ok 👍 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @michaelandrepearce  I think the logic should have been updated on QueueImpl for the exclusive consumer...


You should just had the pos always 0. or have a different logic without using counters at all. 

The code became non consistent. the pos increases but then there is a statement to always get position 0 if exclusive.
              </div></li><li><div>
                We do the same as if message group which doesn’t increase the pos. If it’s exclusive we don’t increment the pos like with message group 

We can enhance this if needed. Ping me on IRC tomorrow? happy to make further enhancements if wanted.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> Artemis should support a consumer feature where a single consumer receives all messages, even when multiple consumers are present. This capability maintains message ordering while allowing a HA consumer.

ActiveMQ 5.x supports this, as does IBM MQ, Tibco EMS, etc.

                [~jbertram] /   [~martyntaylor] wasn't this added for the new addressing. MaxConsumes=1?
              </div></li><li><div>
                if MaxConsumes=1 did not error with an exception and retained the consumer as pending it would be like the exclusive consumer.
With the exclusive consumer feature, the second or low priority consumer is valid, just not getting any messages. Only when the first consumer goes away does dispatch fallback to the second consumer.
MaxConsumes=1 could work but the client will then have to deal with retrys and timeout and error logs filling up etc.

The original (way back) 5.x use case came from having a HA cluster of active ejb servers with mdbs pointing to the broker, only one should get messages.


              </div></li><li><div>
                5.x has: allConsumersExclusiveByDefault destination policy[1]; if we implement that on a queue, then we cover 90% of the use cases. It does not need to be dynamic, ie: initiated by the first exclusive consumer... mixing exclusive and not exclusive is not the norm.

    You should just had the pos always 0. or have a different logic without using counters at all. 
    
    The code became non consistent. the pos increases but then there is a statement to always get position 0 if exclusive.

    We do the same as if message group which doesn’t increase the pos if it’s exclusive just like it doesn’t if exclusive.
    
    We can enhance this if needed. Ping me on IRC tomorrow? happy to make further enhancements if needed.

    @clebertsuconic as per your comment to look at an alternative QueueImpl with it having separate flow without counters for exclusive. 
    
    IMO i don't think this is a better approach, but i want to offer it to you.
     
    There is an amount of logic that is almost similar but not re-usable or abstract-able (ive done what i could).
    
    This is why i followed the same logic that MessageGroups does when a group already is assigned, 
     which is to override the consumer and then don't update the pos, as it made for a lot smaller change, less intrusive change following a pattern already done with msg groups.
    
    Anyhow if you prefer this then im not dead opposed to this approach just don't think its better, but i offer it for your review.

    @jdanekrh these are the coverity fixes i believe are related to the commit you commented on, as noted the others i believe are due to other commits/pr's that simply you're picking up in the report, or as you noted its fine and i'd agree.
    
    I will merge as soon as PR build is green.
