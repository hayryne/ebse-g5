                [~alessandro.benedetti] - you mentioned on solr-user mailing list that the patch here had Ref Guide changes in it, but I don't see them?

                Hi [~ctargett],

I did the change and pushed, so they were just in the Jira associated&nbsp;Pull Request :
 [GitHub Pull Request #391
|https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/391]I just uploaded the patch as well.
&nbsp;
You can take a look now ( I think the Github Pull Request is easier to read, but feel free to use the patch at your convenience)|
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi [~jpountz],

thanks for your time, I can give you a quick&nbsp;explanation here:

The (positional) coefficient should be a double&nbsp; 0&lt;=x&lt;=1 calculated with 3 possible formulas from the position of the first matching query term in the suggestion ( linear doesn't respect that constraint and can go negative for postion which are farer than 10 positions from the beginning ) :
 * *position_linear*: (1 – 0.10*position): Matches to the start will be given a higher score (Default)
 * *position_reciprocal*: 1/(1+position): Matches to the start will be given a score which decay faster than linear
 * *position_exponential_reciprocal*: 1/pow(1+position,exponent): Matches to the start will be given a score which decay faster than reciprocal

To answer your questions :

1)&nbsp;"turning weight=0 into 1" , so this is an interesting one :
 You don't want all your weights to be 0 for the BlendedInfixSuggester because you would just flat to 0 the positional score of the suggestion, which is the only reason to use the Blended Infix ( if you are not interested in the positional score for the suggestion, you should use the parent suggester : AnalyzingInfixSuggester)
 If you don't configure&nbsp;the weight field ( which is not and shouldn't be mandatory) all your weights go to 0s (org.apache.lucene.search.suggest.DocumentDictionary.DocumentInputIterator#getWeight ) and your BlendedInfixSuggester doesn't blend anything anymore scoring each suggestion a constant 0.
 That was the reason to move the weight 0 to the smallest bigger value ( which in a long data type is 1) .
 With that fix you limit the ability of a user to move certain suggestions to 0 weight ( they can just drop them to 1 weight) , but you gain a good bug fix for the missing weight field scenario.

2) So the chosen of 10 was completely arbitrary to get at least 10 possible ranked outcomes out of the positional coefficient. 
 You may end up in overflows if :&nbsp;&nbsp;


 - the weight is already big enough.
 You are right maybe we can apply that scaling factor only if the weight is small.


The overflow according to my analysis can not come from the coefficient, because&nbsp;the edge cases for linear are :
1 - where input position is 0
-2.1474836370000002E8 &nbsp;- &nbsp;where input position is&nbsp;[Integer.MAX_VALUE|http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE]&nbsp;( which is not going to be achievable as Strings full length are maxed by that value)
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> In the meantime I attached the patch with the overflow edge case fixed and a better handling of the weight just when it is too small.

Happy to discuss the implications of&nbsp;"turning weight=0 into 1" with the community!
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks for the explanations. I 'm not familiar enough with suggesters to move this forward, but this patch still feels hacky to me. It looks like it is working around index-time issues and the fact that the weight is a long rather than a double.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Hi Adrien,
I theoretically agree with you.
The reason I structured the patch this way is because what I noticed so far in my contributions is that a contribution is much more likely to be reviewed and accepted if it fixes a bug with the minimal impact as possible and involving less classes as possible.

The problem here is indeed related the data type of : 
- the suggestion score ( should be double)
- and weght ( should be Long as 0 must be considered different from null)

I would be more than happy to contribute that, but my feeling is that a patch that span over a lot of different classes and areas, would be ignored with the final result of the bug(s) to remain there.
Happy if you( the community in general) contradict me and&nbsp;I will proceed with the data types change approach :)
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~mikemccand] What do you think would be the right fix?

              </div></li><li><div>
                First of all, thanks again Adrien for your time.
I have done the work for the data type migration approach here :
[https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/398]
The patch is affecting many more files as expected, but the strictly BlendedInfixSuggester fix is much more elegant.

The drawbacks are that :
- much more attention is needed to review the new patch
- it should be pretty safe, but introducing nulls around, I never feel&nbsp;fully comfortable unless I am super confident of my tests

in case this approach is preferred and someone from the community commit to take care of the review process, I&nbsp;am more than happy to spend more effort in this and make it producton ready!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I agree the proposed fix seems somewhat hacky; could we maybe catch these "invalid" weight values during indexing and throw an exception, asking the user to pick more appropriate weights?

And also +1 to discussing switching to double instead of long for our suggesters; maybe open a spinoff issue to discuss?
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                Hi [~mikemccand], thank you for your feedback!
I definitely agree the path with data type migration is the best route to solve the bug(s) elegantly.
I already attached a Pull Request :&nbsp;
[https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/398]

Which :
- move the weight long to Long ( preserving null values with difference to 0 values)
- move the suggestion score to double ( preserving the precision)

It is ready for review and after a first feedback I can work more on that to make it production ready!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Woops sorry [~alessandro.benedetti]; I missed the PR above.&nbsp; I'll have a look.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I like the change in the PR; I left small comments there, that we should document that having a weight is optional so returning null from {{weight}} means there is no weight.

Maybe we should do it only for 8.x since it's a substantial API change?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi [~mikemccand], thanks for your review !
I followed your suggestions and I updated the Pull Request ( fixing a recent merge conflict).
Feel free to check the additional comments in there.

I agree to bring this to 8.x .
When we are close to an acceptable status let me know and I will go on with refinements and double checks&nbsp;to be production ready.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Any update on this ? Can I help anyway with this to move forward ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi [~alessandro.benedetti], sorry for the delay.&nbsp; The PR looks good to me; do all tests (including Solr's) pass?&nbsp; If there are no objections, I'll push this in a few days.

Thanks [~alessandro.benedetti]!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi [~mikemccand],
I just merged the branch with the latest master, no conflicts :&nbsp;
[https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/398]

I am pushing now the patch here in the way all tests will be executed by Jenkins automatically.
If this doesn't work in the next day or so, I will proceed doing the tests locally as well.
              </div></li><li><div>

                Hi [~mikemccand], I just updated the Pull Request and patch.

I have checked ant precommit ant it seems fine to me.
 I have also executed some of the tests ( the one that are related with the Suggesters).
 There were some Solr tests failing. So I addressed that as well.
 let me know, happy to take care of anything that is missing.
i will monitor the Jira issue and check when the robot returns the checks and tests.

                Thanks [~alessandro.benedetti] – the latest patch looks good to me, and passes {{and precommit}} and Lucene tests, but I'm hitting a few Solr failures:

                [~alessandro.benedetti] if you can resolve the solr test failures then we can push forward here :)&nbsp; Thanks!

                Hi [~mikemccand], sorry for the immense delay, but I have been busy/ on holidays and I missed the August comment !
I just updated the PR and a new patch is attached .
The changes added are :
- AnalysingSuggester weight encoded to 0 in the FST when weight is null ( this should be ok as the AnalysingSuggester weight the suggestion with no positional information, so in this case null or 0 weight should have the same semantic)
- SolrJ suggestion weight moved to double from long

let me know!
Happy to work more on it if necessary!
