http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201603.mbox/%3CCAKBQfzQh%3DJ3DrFSgFEY8teRDpEf5Yz3r7eBffTZVVN_9evpBJg%40mail.gmail.com%3E

1) "LICENSE is missing some BSD licensed software":

a) - BSD licensed software copyright 2011-2012, Florian Schoppmann [2]
[2]. ./src/ports/postgres/cmake/FindPostgreSQL.cmake

Action:  Copyright of this file is *not* owned by Florian Schoppmann; that is a mistake.  Copyright is owned by EMC Corporation which is already listed in LICENSE.  Therefore remove the improper copyright line from this file.

b)  - BSD license software copyright 2004, 2015 Sandia Corporation. [3]
[3]. ./cmake/UseLATEX.cmake

Action:  Correct, need to add this one to LICENSE.

c) BSD licensed software copyright 2011 Clement Creusot [4]
[4]. ./cmake/FindArmadillo.cmake

Action:  This file is not needed by MADlib.  Will be deleted.

d) - may want to double check copyright line in this file [1]
[1]. ./src/ports/postgres/modules/pmml/table_to_pmml.sql_in

Action: No action required.  After investigation, this file is BSD license from the previous MADlib work done at EMC.

2) - "NOTICE contains too many copyright lines, copyright lines should not be in NOTICE unless they are from relocated headers [5]:
[5]. http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers

Action: Remove unnecessary line from notice file.

3) BSD headers/legal

"Given the large number of missing headers itâ€™s extremely difficult to review this release,
it is impossible to know if an individual file without a header is BSD or Apache licensed.
Going forward to know if a file is missing an Apache header you would need to compare it with
the previous release which is hardly ideal. Hopefully the legal discussion will come to some
conclusion / consensus and the header situation can be resolved in future releases."

The legal-discuss on how to proceed re: missing BSD licensing headers is here:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-legal-discuss/201603.mbox/%3C9D1AF43C-370B-4E58-B0EF-2E29D242F50B%40jaguNET.com%3E
Currently we have satisfactorily addressed this as per the legal-discuss thread.  We are open to any additional guidance from the IPMC regarding this issue in the future.

                To address the second issue, I think we should remove the following lines from the NOTICE file:

Portions Copyright (c) 2001, Dr Martin Porter. All rights reserved.
Portions Copyright (c) 2002, Richard Boulton. All rights reserved.

if their contribution is limited to the Snowball stem project (src/libstemmer). LICENSE file already includes their copyright lines as well as the associated license.  
              </div></li><li><div>
                OK to remove from NOTICE file.
