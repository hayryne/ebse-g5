                </div><div><b>description:</b> Today under "Getting Started" we have a few pages that could belong to a "DevOps" section

- Solr Configuration Files
- Solr Upgrade Notes
- Taking Solr to Production
- Upgrading a Solr Cluster

Some pages from "Managing Solr" section would also fit into this

Lastly the "Solr Control Script Reference" page could go under that as well

About the remaining pages:

bq. Running Solr on HDFS : Under SolrCloud maybe?

I could make an argument for this to go under DevOps...it's related to set up &amp; config.

bq. V2 API : Move this to the Client APIs section?

This page is really meant only to be a placeholder until all of the v2 APIs are fully documented throughout the Guide. Ideally, this page goes away someday, so it's OK if it ends up in a less-than-desirable place.

                bq. I'd like to think a moment more about the title of the "DevOps" section

Spit-balling a bit... maybe "Deployment &amp; Configuration"? Or..."Deployment and Operations"?

(I'm 50/50 on use of "&amp;" vs "and", as you can see)

                Re-ordered the pages as proposed. It turned out to be quite a simple task.

[~ctargett] can you please verify the changes and then I'll go commit it

                I applied the patch and the changes mostly look good, but I made a couple additional changes to put the top level in a better order. I've attached a screenshot of those changes.

                Here's another patch with the changes to the top-level nav.

As things stand right now (on master) {{v2-api.adoc}} is completely orphaned (not listed as a child of any page) and not included in the PDF guide at all ... it's not clear from cassandra's comments if this was intentional -- but if it was, then why not remove the file completely?
