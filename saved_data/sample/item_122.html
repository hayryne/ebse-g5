- routes and other DSL style things may get completely ugly-fied by the auto formatting rules, see: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/444
- PR jibs should be configured to fail if the plugins detect some bad formatted code, something like https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/ea2b52c09bad81b6cc1af5cb9d09983a34af0ebf/poms/build-parent/pom.xml#L236-L273

                I have worked on this as this seemed to be quite a problem of manual fixing too. I will do the fixes and create a PR for this.

   * This PR resolves the use of the manual need for formatting to resolve the error while building antora-ui. 
   
   * Apart from that, I rand `yarn format` for the recent changes and have added instructions in **README.md** for using `yarn format`.

   This looks good to me.
   I don't understand the netlify errors.

   Same here, I am unable to interpret where I might be going wrong.

   Though changes seem to be only in the format, let's see the build pass before we merge this to make sure. I've re-triggered the Netlify build with cleared cache, that usually helps. Netlify seems to have issues checking out source code from github.

   Not sure if the JIRA issue is the right one to use here as CAMEL-14578 was primary targeting auto-formatting the java code of the camel codebase whereas here it is about he website

   The JIRA issue clearly doesn't mention the component and based on the description provided by the author for the issue, it clearly fits the problem faced here as well.

   I know but that issue is already assigned to someone else and now it is a little tricky to know who is working on what so maybe having a subtask assigned to you and with a specific component could have made things a little bit more clear.

                Looks like this still scratch all the DSL format, look at [current|https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/4ea9e6c357371682b855d2d79655b41120331b7a/catalog/camel-route-parser/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/parser/java/MyChoiceRouteBuilder.java] versus [old|https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/24e7866263cd18104a8027e57bae99933095d979/catalog/camel-route-parser/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/parser/java/MyChoiceRouteBuilder.java] where the current one looks much less readable than the old one.

[~lb] For method chaining in DSL, currently, the only way is to use {{// CHECKSTYLE:OFF}} and {{// CHECKSTYLE:ON}} to disable specific snippets.  I'll have a look if the plugin can be hacked a bit to make this transparent.
