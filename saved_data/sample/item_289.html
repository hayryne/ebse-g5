                So it seems this should be in the inspector to detect this similar to what is done with hystrix. And also hystrix is deprecated now in Camel 3.4 onwards, so lets use this one as the default (works also better with quarkus) and is active maintained.

                Not sure how much work it will be but maybe we can replace the *hystrix* dsl with a generic *circuitBreaker* one and have hystrix or mp fault tolerance as possible impl ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think we should have a pluggable generic EIP  like *{{circuitBreaker}}* or *{{faultTolerant}}* and support potentially more than one implementation, as we do for *{{master component}}* as an example.

And remove {{hystrix}} eip.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes MP now no longer uses hystrix so hopefully its easier to integrate with Camel
