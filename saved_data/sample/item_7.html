Remove compile-time dependency towards WinRmMachineLocation, with the
later purpose of allowing the driver factory to be initialized from
higher-level code.

    [BROOKLYN-182] Move winrm-dependent code from brooklyn-core to brooklyn-software-winrm

    [BROOKLYN-182] Don't type-switch amongst location types
    
    Duplicating functions like getSsh* with getWinrm* counterparts should be
    avoided. Replace with a global get*(Class) instead.

    [BROOKLYN-182] Decouple ByonLocationResolver from MachineLocation subtypes
    
    The ByonLocationResolver acts as a registry for windows/linux machine
    types. For now we eliminate the compile-time dependency towards
    SshMachineLocation and WinRmMachineLocation, while maintaining the
    runtmie dependency.
    
    Further on we'll reverse the dependency towards a more consistent
    location type registry.

    @CMoH I wanted to assign [BROOKLYN-182] to you, but I couldn't find your jira account. Do you have one?
