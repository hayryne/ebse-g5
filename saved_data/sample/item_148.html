                </div><div><b>description:</b> On stop of a cluster, handling a close message, we'll go ahead and reassign regions as per normal though the cluster up flag is false.  This is what cause the TestRegionRebalancing test to fail up on hudson just now, #1546.

                Check clusterup flag before going ahead with an assignment.

                I applied to TRUNK.  Lets see how it does up on hudson.

                This patch needs a part two.  While we don't assign any more if cluster is going down, I saw that #1552 build up on hudson failed because load balancer gave a region to a server that we'd asked to shutdown.  The RS proceeded to open the region and since it had come in under the wire, the RS stayed up holding up test completion.

A RS that has been asked to stop -- by user via HBaseAdmin or in a unit test testing balancing -- should reject requests to open regions.  Master should then catch the rejection exception and reassign the region elsewhere.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Here is a part 2. RS will throw new RegionServerClosedException and assign will catch and reassign bypassing the going-down server.

No unit test.  I thought about it a while and its a hard scenario to manufacture in unit test (an held-up regionserver shutdown with a pointed request to open delivered while its midst shutdown).

                Committed.  Resolving.  Will open new issue if problems w/ this implementation.

                I missed an important bit of 3113, actual invocation of the functionality part 2 added.  Heres a bit of a commit message to go with the part3 commit:
