Assuming it is legal to do so, the license text of bundled dependencies which are dual-licensed CDDL+GPL should be modified to specify only the licenses which actually apply to Guacamole (in this case the CDDL).

                There seems to be quite a lot of dual-licensed code for which the GPL portion of the license is not stripped:

That said, it's made clear that it's the non-GPL license chosen. For example:

https://github.com/apache/ode-console/blob/2573d34cc642ad75f09c24531a0cbba67c53c07f/legal/jquery.xpath.js-LICENSE
              </div></li><li><div>
                The same problem exists for Logback, which is dual-licensed EPL+LGPL. The LGPL is Category X, while EPL is not.
