                r: @bjchambers, @charlesccychen 

Here is the first sketch of the Metrics API for Python. Let me know what you think. All comments are very welcome, and I'll incorporate all your suggestions as best I can.

Things that need special review:
* `MetricName`, `MetricKey`, `MetricResult` are simple `namedtuple`s without any validation. Should we leave them be this way?
*  `MetricsEnvironment` is used as a 'global' object that keeps global state. Its methods are a bit python-awkward (e.g. `set_metrics_supported`, `set_current_container`, `unset_current_container`). Should we rename/refactor them? The `@property` decorator doesn't work for class methods.
* `MetricsContainer` has the `get_Counter`, and `get_Distribution` methods. Should we rename them to `counter` and `distribution`?
* `MetricsAggregation` seemed a bit unnatural in `DirectMetrics`, so I moved it to the `cells.py` file. Should we also separate them in Java? (or should I move them to `DirectMetrics` in Python?)
* The class `MetricUpdate` does not exist. Instead, a metric update is of the basic data value of the metrics (e.g. `DistributionData`, or `int`). Does this seem fine?
* Is the documentation good enough? : )

I'll add more unit tests next week, to be sure that the code is safe and sound.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Also, quick description of the files:
* `base.py` - Contains basic types and classes. `MetricName`, `MetricKey`, `MetricResult`, `MetricUpdates`, `Metric`, `Counter`, `Distribution`.
* `metric.py` - Contains user-facing types and classes. `Metrics`, `MetricsFilter`, `MetricsResults`.
* `internal.py` - Contains internal classes `MetricsEnvironment` and `MetricsContainer`.
* `cells.py` - Contains the thread-safe classes to keep the metric data, and combine it `MetricCell`, `CounterCell`, `DistributionCell`, `MetricAggregation` (and subclasses), and `DistributionData`.
* `direct_metrics.py` - Contains the implementation of `DirectMetrics` and `DirectMetric` classes. : )
              </div></li><li><div>
                @charlesccychen @aaltay @bjchambers can you guys take a look ? : )
You can see a simple test case of the metrics API [in this function](https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/pull/1420/files#diff-e09fc7b3e830d61b86119eaac26912ffR130). Do you think this makes sense? Is there something we'd rather do in a different way? (you can take a look at my earlier comments for some questions, and points to consider).

                I've added simplified import of the `Metrics` class, which is the only class that users actually need to import to use metrics. Users can now import it as `from apache_beam.metrics import Metrics`, instead of the whole `from apache_beam.metrics.metric import Metrics`.

                Why is the `Metric` class visible. It seems like users won't be able to do anything useful with it. If its only visible so methods can be called, etc. maybe make it clear that none of these are intended to be sub-classed, rather they are created with the factory methods? And then document how to create each one.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Why not `(metric=&lt;MetricKey&gt;, committed=data, attempted=data)`
              </div></li><li><div>
                For people who know Python more, is there anything like an AtomicReference that supports lockless compare-and-swap? Given that metrics may be modified multiple times while processing each element, acquiring a lock each time can be problematic.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Maybe go further and say sub-classes must be thread safe?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Comment on why this doesn't need to get a lock?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> May be worth having the dirty-bit also have the lock. That way we don't need to get two locks to do the dirty-bit setting within the update method. The downside is that getting metrics then has the same lock...

Alternatively, is there an atomic long or anything like that that could be done via compare-and-swap?

                You may want to look at the recent java changes. The MetricsEnvironment now supports scoped updates, such as:

```
with MetricsEnvironment.set_current_container(container):
  ...
```

That automatically resets it to the previous container. May be useful.

                One thing to think about -- for the Java side, it is possible (although atypical) for the user to get the underlying distribution directly (eg., within the worker) and increment it without going through the delegation. Is that still possible here?

                Is it worth mentioning that this doesn't include anything executable (such as a filter function) because the intention is that this could be used to construct the arguments to an RPC request?

                Can we simplify the imports paths that users have to use by importing some of the classes here into the outer module (as in https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/python-sdk/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/__init__.py)?  Alternatively, we can be more granular in what we expose directly in the apache_beam.metrics interface (for example, we can selectively omit certain implementation detail classes in the public interface).

                Why is this class in this file?  It seems that the intention of "base.py" is to contain the base classes for metrics objects.  this class is unrelated to these classes and is more related to the ones in "internal.py".

                Are there methods that all types of Metrics should implement?  If so, you should define stubs here that raise NotImplementedError.  If not, you should explicitly put "pass" here.

The confusion I had reading these is interfaces are expected to be used as mix-ins for other classes implementing, for example, Counter functionality, while "base class" gives the impression that there are going to be, for example, additional, specialized types of Counters that depend on this.

                In Python, it is generally a best-practice to avoid this pattern of declaring private versions of these member variables and define getters/setters.  Is there a specific reason you do this here?  Otherwise, I suggest storing these values directly (e.g. "self.sum = sum", "self.count = count") and removing the ```@property``` getters for sum, count min and max.
              </div></li><li><div>
                This should be float(self.sum) / self.count to return the correct return type (also, add a docstring indicating that the float mean is returned).

In any case, do you want this property here or in a separate DistributionResult class?  (cc: @bjchambers)  In Java, there is a DistributionResult class separate from DistributionData which holds the result object when 

This is the docstring for DistributionData:

```java
/**
 * Data describing the the distribution. This should retain enough detail that it can be combined
 * with other {@link DistributionData}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This is kept distinct from {@link DistributionResult} since this may be extended to include
 * data necessary to approximate quantiles, etc. while {@link DistributionResult} would just include
 * the approximate value of those quantiles.
 */
```
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Can you make the docstring more explicit?  "holds data" is very vague.  This is the corresponding docstring for DistributionData.java:

```java
/**
 * Data describing the the distribution. This should retain enough detail that it can be combined
 * with other {@link DistributionData}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This is kept distinct from {@link DistributionResult} since this may be extended to include
 * data necessary to approximate quantiles, etc. while {@link DistributionResult} would just include
 * the approximate value of those quantiles.
 */
```

What is the type of the values in this structure?  We should be clear what is allowed by the API and explicitly cast input to this type in the constructor.  @bjchambers: in your DistributionData.java, you use "long"s--is this an intended restriction of the values through this API?

                Note that the Java docstring is:

```java
/**
 * Tracks the current value (and delta) for a Distribution metric.
 */
```
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> In the Java version of this code, there are two classes: (1) DistributionData for accumulating partial distributions during pipeline execution and (2) DistributionResult for representing these results as a user API.  For example, this means that the .mean() method should be removed from DistributionData (since it should never be called during accumulation of partial distributions) but included in DistributionResult; correspondingly, the combine() method should be included in DistributionData but not in DistributionResult.  Should we do the same thing here?

                "internal.py" is a very vague name.  Because this file contains classes that are used for collecting metrics during pipeline execution, I suggest renaming this class "execution.py".

Additionally, I suggest moving the MetricKey and MetricResult classes from "base.py" to this file (and renaming "base.py" to "metricbase.py" as described in the comments on that file).
              </div></li><li><div>
                Can you test that passing float values to DistributionData will clip the float values to be integers?  For example, combining [3.1, 3.2, 3.3] here give would clip each value to int(3) first before accumulating into the distribution.  Also maybe test that passing float('inf') raises an OverflowError.

@bjchambers: since we don't have explicit typing in this API, does this seem reasonable to you?  Do we want to keep the int restriction on values in the distribution metric?
              </div></li><li><div>
                This should is not really a base class for metrics; rather, it is used for execution and corresponds more to the classes defined in "internal.py".

                In Java there's no check for this either. I feel like raising an error or returning `None` are both decent options. Should we err on the side of consistency for this?

The problem with the Aggregator API is that it is unclear where we want to take this -- there are many paths, and relatively little consensus. Once we finalize that, we should have a discussion about the proper name. For now, we seem to be trying to find a descriptive name for something that we don't yet know what it is or what it is going to be. This doesn't sound like the right way to go; and/or we'll find ourselves in a situation where the name no longer describes the concept well enough.

Robert, what do you think? I wouldn't touch this for the time being, let Aggregators evolve in its own right.

commit 40961aa24468c810f5f3377620fe14bc7d40c55c
Author: bchambers &lt;bchambers@google.com&gt;
Date:   2016-09-20T19:44:39Z

    Initial prototype of Beam Metrics API
    
    This is labeled @Experimental since it is only supported by the Direct
    Runner and may change as it is implemented in other runners.
    
    Future work includes adding additional kinds of metrics and wiring them
    up to the various runners.

    Allow passing logging context directly.
    
    This is better than passing a logger module with a specific class.

Date:   2016-07-27T17:09:49Z

    Better top implementation.
    
    When selecting the top k of n, it is common that k &lt;&lt; n.
    Using a heap is O(n log k) while select algorithms can
    achieve O(n + k log k).
    
    This also avoids the ugliness that heapq does not take the
    comparator as an argument, resulting in _HeapItem classes that
    were cumbersome and expensive to serialize.

commit 866a09d6c5c4c1c3c39d3a1f2e7b4cb7ec319f6f
Author: Robert Bradshaw &lt;robertwb@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   2016-07-27T19:23:02Z

    Allow Top operations to take key argument rather than compare.
    
    Also support ordering by the natural ordering if neither is specified,
    and a reverse option.  This is both an API and performance improvement.

    Optimize Map and Flatmap when there are no side inputs.
    
    varargs and kwargs are expensive, even when they're empty.
    
    This is especially true for otherwise one-argument Python calls
    which are special cased in CPython.
