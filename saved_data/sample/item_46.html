Default implementation for Dataflow requires you to specify the runnableOnServicePipelineOptions
system property with a valid project/runner/... to be able to execute on Google Cloud Dataflow.

Default implementation for Flink and Spark are to have it disabled.

Note the whitespace formatting fix on spark pom.xml

                The plan is to create a java-dataflow runner maven module and move over the DataflowPipelineRunner and relevant support code over to this new module.

    [BEAM-151] Move maven archetypes build order to be after runners
    
    Currently sdks/java/maven-archetypes has several dependencies
    on the DataflowPipelineRunner. This is mainly throw the utility
    class called DataflowExampleUtils.
    
    This is a temporary workaround till examples get updated
    to use only beam SDK.

    Note that Flink runner and Java examples both depend on the Dataflow runner still. So I needed to make the Dataflow runner a top level component to satisfy these dependencies.
    
    Also, we are currently shading within the Dataflow runner and using the same namespace to reduce the jar size.

    [BEAM-151] Move a large portion of the Dataflow runner to separate maven module
    
    Note that Flink runner and Java examples both depend on the Dataflow runner
    still. So I needed to make the Dataflow runner a top level component to
    satisfy these dependencies.

    Added surefire.dependencyToScan and surefire.testPipelineOptions configuration options
    
    surefire.dependencyToScan adds an additional dependency used to find tests.
    This allows for java-sdk-all to be added to all runners for running
    the @Category(RunnableOnService.class) tests.
    
    surefire.testPipelineOptions configures the pipeline options used while
    constructing instances of a TestPipeline. A json list of arguments
    is expected, for example:
    [ "--runner=MyRunner", "--myRunnerOption=myRunnerValue" ]

    Default implementation for Dataflow requires you to specify the runnableOnServicePipelineOptions
    system property with a valid project/runner/... to be able to execute on Google Cloud Dataflow.
    
    Default implementation for Flink and Spark are to have it disabled.
    
    Note the whitespace formatting fix on spark pom.xml

                No, I still need to update package-info.java and make another pass over the remaining classes to see if there are any stragglers.

    Note that users should use proto ByteString instead of RandomAccessData
    since it provides a safer version of the same functionality.
    
    I hoped that I would be able to move over more of the *Cloud* classes
    and their helpers but they are embedded part of coders. Nothing more
    can be done here until there is an official Beam representation of a coder
    decoupled from Dataflow CloudKnownTypes.
