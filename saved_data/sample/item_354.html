- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:

Address #1003

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:

Address #1003

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:

Address #1003

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:

Address #1003

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:

Address #1003

### Description

- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:

When user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:
1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or
2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.
This PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.

This PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.

Add more accurate error message for resetPartition

This commit adds more specific messages for failure reason for reserPartion. It also adds a unit test for resetPartition.

                Suggest diamond `new HashSet&lt;&gt;()`
And it seems the partitions are only used for next step `containsAll()`. Would it be fine just use the reference to keySet() `partitions = Address unclean helix controller leadership switch`, instead of making a copy?

                No need to catch this exception. If an exception is thrown from connect(), the test will throw this exception and fail.

                Looks like either branch of the below if/else needs this, might as well just init `partitions` here?

Also, since the original code makes a copy, better keep the original semantics here to prevent accidental mutation.

                Looks like there is a slight difference `getMapFields` vs `getListFields` requires this if-else, so perhaps a ternary operator or the current if-else is already unavoidable.

              </div></li><li><div>
                BTW, if this is for the format, just use the auto format supported by the IDE after you import the Helix code style.

                The check only shows it is not alive for now. "anymore" is not accurate, we can remove it.

                nit, You can init the errMessage like String.format( "Can't reset state for %s.%s on %s,", resourceName, partitionNames, instanceName), then in the different branches, append more content.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> nit, you could use (idealState.getRebalanceMode() == RebalanceMode.CUSTOMIZED)? idealState.getRecord().getMapFields().keySet() : partitions = idealState.getRecord().getListFields().keySet() to simplify it a little bit.

                Please correct me if I am wrong. In my understanding, if the instance has ever lived in the cluster, we would be able to find it under /instance Path but not under the /liveInstance ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                The auto formatter collapse 2 lines into 1 line and leave the "+" here.  I missed it.  Will fix

                TFTR. May I ask are you suggesting verify if the resource is enabled? In my understanding, if not, then we won't get the expected exception for nonexistent partitions in the next try/catch block. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Same as above. If the instance is not corrected added and enabled, we wont get all following expected exceptions. 

              </div></li><li><div>
                TFTR. Will fix.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Please correct me if I am wrong. For example, I guess if we get "resource not added" exception while "nonexistent partition" is expected, we would know the resource is not correctly added.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> nit, this is about style.
In Java, you can put fields into enum items. This format string can be a field of the ResetPartitionFailureReason enum item. Then you don't need the switch here.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                This test case works but not very clean. Since the testResource has not been created, the resetPartition may fail due to other reasons. So the test logic here might be impacted if we change that logic. For example, we check the resource existence first in the future.

To avoid that impact, let's have the resource created and then test reset.
BTW, in that case, you will need to use the verifier to wait until resource assignment has been done and state converged.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Nit, just about style :) To reduce the duplicate code, I would do something like this
```
String failureReason = _zkClient.exists(instancePath) ? ResetPartitionFailureReason.INSTANCE_NONEXISTENT) :  ResetPartitionFailureReason.INSTANCE_NOTALIVE);
throw new HelixException(...);

                I would suggest passing the cluster name to getMessage, and let it return the fully formated string.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Some messages require 2 args an others need one arg. Please correct me if I am wrong but I think it is hard to return a fully formated string if we do not add extra logic here.
