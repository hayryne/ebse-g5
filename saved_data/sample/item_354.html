                 TODO(BEAM-2685): Issue with dill + local classes + abc metaclass
 import abc
 @abc.abstractmethod is disabled here to avoid an error with mypy. mypy
 performs abc.abtractmethod/property checks even if a class does
 not use abc.ABCMeta, however, functions like `register_pickle_urn`
 dynamically patch `to_runner_api_parameter`, which mypy cannot track, so
 mypy incorrectly infers that this method has not been overridden with a
 concrete implementation.

                </div><div><b>message:</b> [BEAM-7746] Silence a bunch of errors about "Cannot instantiate abstract class"

abc.ABCMeta has been removed from this class with a fixme (BEAM-2685), which
means there' no longer any runtime checking of @abc.abstractmethod. However,
mypy still performs abc.abtractmethod/property checks even if a class does
not use abc.ABCMeta (this is a feature that lets you avoid using metaclasses).

The problem arises because the beam code is doing a lot of dynamic patching of
to_runner_api_parameter (see register_pickle_urn), which mypy cannot track, so
it believes this method is missing.

We comment out @abc.abstractmethod, to disable the mypy checks (it's already
disabled at runtime by virtue of an earlier change to remove abc.ABCMeta).
We change the method to raise NotImplementedError to inform pylint not to trust
its return value (None) and to get some degree of runtime checking.

                WDYT about adding a pytype (https://github.com/google/pytype) tox target as well?
This will help maintain type hint compatibility with Google-internal tests.
