                </div><div><b>body:</b> Currently, Helix only supports a single state for every partition. There're increasing requests from customers to have more than one state, which is defined in Helix state model, for their practical use. For example, they may want to have read/write state, quota state, version state, etc. Helix will introduce the concept of customized state, which allows customer to define the states they are interested. Helix will also aggregate the customized states and provides an aggregated view for customers, similar to the existing EXTERNAL_VIEW. The customized view snapshot will be present in routingtableprovider.
