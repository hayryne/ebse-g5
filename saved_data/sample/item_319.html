                Hi Gary, I have written something similar for Maven Embedder recently: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=maven.git;a=blob;f=maven-embedder/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/cli/transfer/AbstractMavenTransferListener.java;h=e72aa47d8ec3fe147ebebb74ce921d9484a85adb;hb=HEAD#l50
              </div></li><li><div>
                Interesting, thanks for the pointer. Note that I made a point of following the patter set in the JRE's own {{TimeUnit}}.
              </div></li><li><div>
                My implementation leans partially on the {{TimeUnit}} but adapted for the usecase. Feel free to nag me if you need someone who evaluates your ideas.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Has this been completed with commit 04e52eb6155b3cbf5fffc0d52689a3f679e40b19?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Definitively not for me. There are several errors in the implementation and I see to no reason to split. One can simply have them in one {{enum}} {{SizeUnit}} and SI prefixes and IEC prefixes. Additionally, this class encourages bad and misleading naming of units. It needs a redesign.

                Is this something that has to be fixed before the 3.5 release?
              </div></li><li><div>
                These classes deserve a complete redesign. I would rather move this commit to a branch until it properly fixed for general use.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Moving this issue to 3.6 for further discussion.

                Reverted this for now in commit 8d682a6aa32964811e971f58e36b418605ba4233. Run {{git revert 8d682a6aa32964811e971f58e36b418605ba4233}} to restore the code for polishing after 3.5 has been released.
