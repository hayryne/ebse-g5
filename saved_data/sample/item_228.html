                </div><div><b>description:</b> We removed the ack&gt;1 support from the producer client in kafka-1555. We can completely remove the code in the broker that supports ack&gt;1.

Also, we probably want to make NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend a non-retriable exception and let the client decide what to do.

                We probably can wait under KAFKA-1583 is done since code change will likely be easier then.

                Either I'm missing something or this was trivial :)

From what I can see:
If acks = 0 || acks = 1, we only append to local log.
If acks = -1, we produce with delay.
So I simply removed the part where we count acks in delayed produce. 


              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> On a related note (which maybe should have been caught in KAFKA-1555), the docs on the broker configs is now kind of misleading. Both old and new versions say something like "common values are", but really the values listed are the only valid options.

                Per [~ewencp]'s suggestion, I added early validation of ack values. 

I also wanted to test that validation, which ended up being a rather more involved test than I wanted.

If anyone has suggestions on a simpler way to test API handlers (i.e. without a SocketServer), I'm all ears.

                With this patch I think we should change the existing functionality with &gt; 1 update to start to LOG as a WARN in the Broker (so it gets people attention to stop using ack &gt;1) but keep everything else the same... the new version of the request (with a match/case) should do the new functionality and we support both.
              </div></li><li><div>
                From the discussion in the mailing list, we decided not to bump up the version for the ProduceRequest. Instead, we will log a warning in 0.8.2 that ack&gt;1 will no longer to supported. In 0.8.3, we will throw an exception to requests with ack&gt;1 and remove the support from the code. [~gwenshap], do you want to update KIP-1 in the wiki accordingly?
