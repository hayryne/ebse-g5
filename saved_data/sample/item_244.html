                FWIW: This is likely to require DRAT to get a budget approved from the board, as it's a rather large request.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Daniel - what would not require budget approval? I kind of stabbed in the dark here, but may be able to work something smaller. Please let me know.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The specs (besides the disk) and setup look good.  What's the requirement for a 2 TB disk?
              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Daniel, the 2 TB is to cache/download ASF git repos (which DRAT requires locally). It's really a cache disk, so I could set up something fancy to delete when done. That's really the only requirement. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                We have an implementation standard of Ubuntu 16.04 for project VMs running within our infrastructure. I trust this won't be an issue.

              </div></li><li><div>
                hey Chris, no worries. I'm a yum guy, but can use apt-get too ;)
              </div></li><li><div>
                hi team, [~cml] ping can you provide status on this request? Thank you!

                OK. We should have it set up by the end of this weekend.

              </div></li><li><div>
                awesome thank you so much

                hi [~cml] is the VM ready?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sorry, not quite yet. Should be soon. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The VM is ready for use.

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Chris! appreciate it. I verified I can log in. I don't have sudo (tried sudo 'ls'). Not that I need it *right* this second, but it may be good to have. Is it something you provide on the VMs? I'll move forward with DRAT install and see if all looks good. Are the HTTPD proxies set up? Thanks!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ran into the first case where I may need sudo - the machine doesn't have Maven3. May I have sudo so I can apt-get install stuff?
              </div></li><li><div>
                You do have sudo. You will need to set up orthrus: https://reference.apache.org/committer/opie

Yes, the proxies (and https via letsencrypt) are also set up 

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Chris. Sigh. I keep getting:

Error: Failed to verify password for user mattmann: invalid response. (20014)

When trying to use SkeyCalc locally on my Mac. Any guidance? It says contact infra if I entered my password wrong or something?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I removed the broken key. Check out the video on the reference link for opie.

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Chris it's fixed now, thanks works great!
              </div></li><li><div>
                can we set my preferred shell to /bin/bash? I tried doing that with id.apache.org but it won't let me edit that field?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sure. updated.

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Chris!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Chris both proxies and HTTPS counterparts give a 404...but drat is up and i checked the sites are too using lynx please check thanks
              </div></li><li><div>
                They seem to work for me

https://drat-vm.apache.org/asfgit/
https://drat-vm.apache.org/demo/

              </div></li><li><div>
                that's great the proxies work - as I originally requested though are we able to proxy from drat.apache.org (and not drat-vm?) for example we did this with whimsy I believe at one point. I would love those same proxies to work except without the *-vm part.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I see. I misunderstood. You should be able to set those up on your TLP website with .htaccess 
              </div></li><li><div>
                no worries at all Chris. In fact, the *-vm ones are fine for now. Can you tell me how to set them up on the TLP site with some specific instructions. I'm sorry if I'm being dense. For example I know how to make an .htaccess file. Where should I put it? SVN, Git? If you can just let me know where to put things and how to test it I would appreciate it. Thank you.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It will be easier if I set the redirects up directly in the TLP config I think. I'll take care of it shortly.

              </div></li><li><div>
                I set up an http -&gt; https redirect for drat.a.o and added the two redirects to the drat TLP site config. these won't be overwritten by any other site content you eventually push.

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Chris! confirmed it works great.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Chris can I get 2 more HTTP(S) proxy redirects? These ones, can you use LDAP authentication and use the DRAT LDAP PMC group to manage HTTP(S) auth on these proxies?

https://drat.apache.org/oodt/ =&gt; http://drat-vm.apache.org:8080/opsui/
https://drat.apache.org/solr/  =&gt; http://drat-vm.apache.org:8080/solr/

I think once these are up we're good to go and we can close this out. Thank you!

(side note, I filed: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-15489 to get the DRAT.apache.org actual website up and running with GitPubSub and wanted to flag it for you since we want to preserve these proxies whilst still creating the site). Thanks!
              </div></li><li><div>
                hi Chris, just checking if you saw my addtl' request for the 2 proxies. Thanks!
              </div></li><li><div>
                LDAP auth would be something you'd implement within your service. While it's technically possible to put LDAP auth in front of a proxy, it would be kind of useless, as anyone can just hit the proxied service directly, and there is no authentication passthrough. Take a look at how Whimsy is set up for an example of a project service using LDAP authentication.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Chris - can you add the proxies the same way you added the other 2 please, then? Can you point me at the Whimsy conf you are talking about? in the meanwhile if you can create:

https://drat.apache.org/oodt/ =&gt; http://drat-vm.apache.org:8080/opsui/
https://drat.apache.org/solr/ =&gt; http://drat-vm.apache.org:8080/solr/

I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Chris

              </div></li><li><div>
                A copy of the whimsy  config can be found here:

https://github.com/apache/whimsy/blob/master/config/whimsy.conf

For the DRAT PMC, the relevant configuration would look like:

  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "DRAT PMC"
  AuthBasicProvider ldap
  AuthLDAPUrl "ldaps://ldap2-us-west.apache.org:636 ldap1-us-west.apache.org:636/ou=people,dc=apache,dc=org?uid"
  AuthLDAPGroupAttribute owner
Require ldap-group cn=drat,ou=project,ou=groups,dc=apache,dc=org

              </div></li><li><div>
                thanks Sam. Chris - are we able to use the above in the requested 2 proxies that I would like to create. Only need it for /solr and /oodt 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Trying to use your TLP site as a front-end for a production application isn't going to work very well. If you want to set up authentication, that is something you would do directly on your project VM. My recommendation to you at this point would be to think of a service DNS name that isn't the TLP name (like "drat-app.a.o" or similar,) we'll point it at your VM, and you can do the appropriate proxying and LDAP authentication directly on your project VM. Setting this up as part of the TLP site is going to be problematic for the reasons I mentioned above (no auth passthrough, people can hit the proxy target directly.)

              </div></li><li><div>
                no worries, Chris. 

drat-vm.a.o is fine by me. I see i can access /opsui and /solr there on 8080. What file would I modify (and where?) with Sam's suggested config above to achieve the auth I'm looking for? Thanks.

              </div></li><li><div>
                The unauthenticated proxies for oodt and solr should be live in 30 minutes or so. Infra doesn't usually get involved in configuring details of project VMs. In terms of examples, I think steve-vm is probably the simplest one in terms of setting up LDAP:

https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/data/nodes/steve-vm.apache.org.yaml

You'd basically just add the LDAP config to the drat-vm vhost yaml https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-puppet/blob/deployment/data/nodes/drat-vm.apache.org.yaml
