the Lucene/Solr project has already migrated content out of Confluence that is now hosted on lucene.apache.org.

We would like INFRAs help deploying mod_rewrite related changes to cwiki.apache.org in order to redirect the "old" Confluence URLs to the "new" locations of this content on lucene.apache.org.

They are well commented, but i'm happy to answer any questions or revise them as needed to assist INFRA.

                anything i can do to help move this forward?
              </div></li><li><div>
                We are discussing this internally.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Because of the recent weirdness/breakage of INFRA-14971, there is now some increased urgency/concern in getting these redirects in place -- because at present, people finding their way to the cwiki pages aren't just seeing older/stale content, they are now seeing older/stale content where most of the useful bits (in code blocks) are missing.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~cml]: can you provide a rough ETA on when we might see these redirects added, or at least some elaboration on what sort of of internal discussions/concerns infra has about these changes -- so that I can relay to the developers &amp; community members concerned about getting these redirects in place (particularly due to INFRA-14971)

And again: If there's anything I can do to help move things forward (updating the configs to assume a diff RewriteBase, use a different apache mod to do the redirects, more testing, etc...) please let me know.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for your patience, this is approved and is just waiting on me to implement the change. I expect to have it ready for testing by the end of the week. 

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> This has been implemented. Please review and let us know if anything isn't working.

                thanks chris, everything seems to be working as expected.
