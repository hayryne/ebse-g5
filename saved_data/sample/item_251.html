                </div><div><b>description:</b> As described in [CVE-2019-12402|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12402], {{commons-compress:1.18}} has an issue where certain inputs may cause an infinite loop which leads to a denial of service attack.

This patch simply upgrades {{common-compress}} versions from 1.18 to 1.19 which is the latest minor version at the date of filing this issue ([Maven repo|https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-compress]).

I would like to figure out 'Affects Version/s' and 'Fix Version/s' (and other required labels), and it would be great if someone could point me to a right direction. A wiki page, a guideline, or anything like that would be a great help. Thanks.

                Regarding the [second comment from Hive QA|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-22374?focusedCommentId=16960428&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16960428], the error message states that:

{code}
Tests exited with: Exception: Patch URL https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12984122/HIVE-22374.2.patch was found in seen patch url's cache and a test was probably run already on it. Aborting...
{code}

In such case, I suppose I don't have to take any further action, right?

              </div></li><li><div>
                Normally you'd have to reattach, as this step performs some codecheks/validations, but since this is just a minimal version bump and the tests passed, I'd doubt there's anything needed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                tests already passed for 2.patch, so +1
