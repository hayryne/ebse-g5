                Here's a patch with just those test cases that apply to this bug from HDFS-1139.

Note: this does change the exception text coming out of completeFile to be more specific - now it actually contains "Lease mismatch" or "File is closed", etc, rather then the generic "Could not complete file" that it used to. I think this is a good thing, just wanted to note that it does have user-facing implications.

                Branch 20 patch for the HDFS-142-based append (not for commit to branch 20)
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think the previous code clearly distinguished (via the log message) whether the file was a valid file that was already completed or whether it has a lease. Does the new log message work if the file is already closed?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, the LeaseExpiredException thrown by checkLease is informative - see FSNamesystem.checkLease. It will say "File does not exist" vs "File is not open for writing" vs "Lease mismatch" depending on the circumstance. This will make it to the log as well as back to the client (the prior implementation just gave back a generic IOE to the client saying it could not complete)

                Test failure is the normal "port out of range: -1" shenanigans, nothing related to this patch.

                +1, code looks good. I will commit in a day unless somebody else has any other review comments.

                +1 thanks for working on it, Todd.

Minor: Look like that pendingFile won't be null since the checkLease(..) method below will throw a LeaseExpiredException when file == null.
{code}
//FSNamesystem
  private void checkLease(String src, String holder, INode file) 
                                                     throws IOException {

    if (file == null || file.isDirectory()) {
      Lease lease = leaseManager.getLease(holder);
      throw new LeaseExpiredException("No lease on " + src +
      ...
{code}
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for taking a look, Nicolas.

bq. Minor: Look like that pendingFile won't be null since the checkLease(..) method below will throw a LeaseExpiredException when file == null.

Not sure what you're referring to - the patch removes the checks against pendingFile == null. We now check only for fileBlocks == null. Are you suggesting I remove fileBlocks and the associated null check? That seems reasonable, since fileBlocks itself isn't used outside the null check.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Updated patch based on Nicholas's feedback. I also removed CompleteFileStatus entirely, since we were only using the success/wait codes, it's easier to just use boolean.

Oops, I mixed up pendingFile and fileBlocks.

I just have checked the codes.  fileBlocks also won't possibly be null, given that pendingFile is an INodeFileUnderConstruction.

+1 the new patch looks good.

                The failed tests are unrelated (TestNodeCounts passes locally). I'll file a JIRA for the TestNodeCounts failure separately if there isn't already one, since it's rather worrisome!
