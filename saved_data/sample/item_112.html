                I've spun off the remaining tasks as separate JIRAs, CAMEL-639 and CAMEL-640.

I made a minor refactor at the last minute to use 'trace' as the property rather than 'tracing'

The Spring XML test case is in camel-spring called SpringTraceTest
              </div></li><li><div>
                there's now a trace flag on DefaultCamelContext and &lt;camelContext trace="true"/&gt; to easily enable tracing
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> If its part of the new debugger feature then please add documentation about this new option in the wiki

http://activemq.apache.org/camel/debugger.html

And btw the debugger wiki is probably out of date with the latest commits.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I have enabled the breadcrumb so unit of work id is logged so end users can use it for correlation. 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Maybe the exchange id should be outputted by default? If you have concurrent exchanges then it can be harder to view/grep/filter in the logfiles for the same exchange.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                BTW added a FAQ entry...
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/How+do+I+debug+my+route

              </div></li><li><div>
                Updated the wiki. Only a spring XML example is missing.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Would be great if the tracer could output the from parts as well ;) 

from: XXXX -&gt; to: YYYY: exchange: AAAA, BBBB, CCCC

And then it could also consider redelivery as well. Outputting if the execution is a redelivery and what count it is.
              </div></li><li><div>
                James could we have the wiki updated with your new option and some sample output from the new trace interceptor?

I do think I will try to give a go at it so I can see what it really does ;)
This is more or less the last ticket for 1.4 so we could cut a new RC this week.
              </div></li><li><div>
                BTW Claus did a great job of documenting it here...
