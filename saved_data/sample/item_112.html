This will be possible if you externalize method which create FileConsumer in the body of createConsumer :

{code}FileConsumer result = new FileConsumer(this, processor, operations);{code}

could be refactor in :


{code}FileConsumer result = newFileConsumer(processor, operations);
...
protected FileConsumer newFileConsumer(Processor processor, GenericFileOperations&lt;File&gt; operations){
return new FileConsumer(this, processor, operations)
}{code}

                Anyone in our community want to provide a patch for this?
Mind that there is also the camel-ftp component which may need to be adjusted.

                Claus,

you simply take over all those tricky &amp; tough stuff for yourself to fix (namespace aware xml streaming tokenizier support, just to mention one of those last features), and leave us alone with such trival fixes... this's simply not fair ;-)

I see a good match here of your definition for the professionalism and the action you took today by this ticket:

http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/HEADS-UP-Adjustments-to-ExecutorServiceManager-on-trunk-tp4693698p4715407.html

Regards, Babak
 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Sorry for the delay, but I can't provide a unit test, but I've given to you a patch in the description of this JIRA.

The solution is to externalize the FileConsumer creation into a new method which could be overloaded. 
Then you could use a different implementation of FileConsumer, like below:

{code}

public class PollConditionFileEndpont extends FileEndpoint {

    @Override
    protected FileConsumer newFileConsumer(Processor processor, FileOperations operations) {
    	return new FileConsumer(this, processor, operations){
    		@Override
    		protected boolean prePollCheck() throws Exception {
    			return Boolean.parseBoolean("customizable condition");
    		}
    	};
    }

    
}
{code}

So, could you re-open this JIRA ?

Thanks

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Well maybe instead of a newFileConsumer it would be better to offer an API for easier providing custom prePoll / postPoll logic to the file consumer?

Then people do not have to extend components in Camel.

That said I went ahead and created the newFileConsumer + unit test.

We do love contributions. Read here. Also how to provide patches, as ASF have policy for how thats to happen:
http://camel.apache.org/contributing.html

If you are eager to get this into the code base, then helping out yourself is great for the community. And after the first patch, it becomes easier to submit the next patch ...

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I also need to create different consumers based on the options provided in the new component I'm working on. Any proposals how the API could be extended for that purpose in a generic way applicable for all component?
              </div></li><li><div>
                For all components? Not just a file based component?
If so then I suggest to use @dev to talk about such, as its not related very mich to this JIRA ticket.
