Does this work for you?

                I'm wondering why CQL is being parsed in the client at all? Couldn't we just handle the exceptions thrown by cassandra? That way we wouldn't have to keep cqlsh in sync with CQL development on the C*-side.

                bq. I'm wondering why CQL is being parsed in the client at all? Couldn't we just handle the exceptions thrown by cassandra? That way we wouldn't have to keep cqlsh in sync with CQL development on the C*-side.

cqlsh has to attempt to parse input in order to recognize keyspace switches, provide tab-completion, implement the cqlsh-specific commands, separate multiple statements, and (in the future) to allow things like CASSANDRA-3799.

Yes, of course, if cqlsh can identify a CQL statement but can't parse it, and it doesn't recognize the command word as being cqlsh-specific, it should pass the CQL on untouched to Cassandra. The problem in this ticket was with cqlsh deciding incorrectly that the user intended to give a cqlsh-only command.
