                </div><div><b>description:</b> In createSocketForPipeline(), connect() is called with a timeout set to (socket_timeout + read_extension * num_datanodes). Since it is simply connecting to a single node, it does not make sense to increase connection timeout based on the number of datanodes.

DFSInputStream is doing it correctly both in trunk and branch-2.

                Per Kihwal's suggestion, the patches use client.getConf().socketTimeout for the timeout (the same way as DFSInputStream does it) instead of client.getDatanodeReadTimeout(length). This changes only the createSocketForPipeline() method.

              </div></li><li><div>
                The timeout used in {{setSoTimeout(timeout)}} after making connection needs to stay the same.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Will submit new patches in which the setSoTimeout is correctly set.
              </div></li><li><div>
                The new (v2) patches use the correct timeout after making the connection.
