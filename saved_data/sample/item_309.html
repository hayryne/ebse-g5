                Nice fix to address the error handling problem. Related #12280

BTW, I think ultimately we have to catch all exceptions (MXNetError or DMLC error) in python so interactive session will no longer crash by segmentation fault or something.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @zhreshold interactive session wont crash after this change but will throw an MXNetError. I am not completely sure what you mean though.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @anirudh2290 I mean, we need to catch all exceptions. For example:

```python3
import mxnet as mx
a = mx.nd.zeros((1,2))
mx.nd.smooth_l1(a)
```
crash with 
```bash
libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::invalid_argument: stod: no conversion
Abort trap: 6
```
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @zhreshold got it. Yes this has been on the backlog for a long time now. We currently catch only dmlc::Errors but we also need to have corresponding frontend exceptions for std::exception and handle them. I had documented it here : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Improved+Exception+Handling+in+MXNet+-+Phase+2
