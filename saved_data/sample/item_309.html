* Initial attempt at linking tutorials in CI

* Update CI to link tutorials

* update

* update typos

* Update ubuntu_scala.sh

trying to find out why sometimes it crashes

* trigger build

* trigger build

- Adding the tutorials to the CI
- Adding a CI setting to set container shared memory size `--shm-size`
- Adding a sanity check to tutorials:
    - Every tutorial needs to be downloadable (except whitelist)
    - Every tutorial needs to be tested (except whitelist)

Future improvements:
- Currently, only sequential run (multiprocessing run is flaky and can leave orphan processes running)

❄️ Flakiness:
- cold image build -&gt; Marco will improve the image build system
     - ~~Scala install script~~ (fixed)
     - R install script (?)
- ~~`mldata.org` for MNIST data is flaky, failing the GAN tutorial -&gt;using gluon dataset~~ (fixed)
- ~~missing seed for sparse tutorial~~ (fixed)

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## Description ##

- Adding the tutorials to the CI
- Adding a CI setting to set container shared memory size `--shm-size`
- Adding a sanity check to tutorials:
    - Every tutorial needs to be downloadable (except whitelist)
    - Every tutorial needs to be tested (except whitelist)

Future improvements:
- Currently, only sequential run (multiprocessing run is flaky and can leave orphan processes running)

❄️ Flakiness:
- cold image build -&gt; Marco will improve the image build system
     - ~~Scala install script~~ (fixed)
     - R install script (?)
- ~~`mldata.org` for MNIST data is flaky, failing the GAN tutorial -&gt;using gluon dataset~~ (fixed)
- ~~missing seed for sparse tutorial~~ (fixed)

                </div><div><b>body:</b> ## Description ##

- Adding the tutorials to the CI
- Adding a CI setting to set container shared memory size `--shm-size`
- Adding a sanity check to tutorials:
    - Every tutorial needs to be downloadable (except whitelist)
    - Every tutorial needs to be tested (except whitelist)

Future improvements:
- Currently, only sequential run (multiprocessing run is flaky and can leave orphan processes running)

❄️ Flakiness:
- cold image build -&gt; Marco will improve the image build system
     - ~~Scala install script~~ (fixed)
     - R install script (?)
- ~~`mldata.org` for MNIST data is flaky, failing the GAN tutorial -&gt;using gluon dataset~~ (fixed)
- ~~missing seed for sparse tutorial~~ (fixed)


@marcoabreu , if you would like to review thanks!

                This filepath makes the tests non-parallelizable. Are you going to introduce parallelization at a later point?

                That's the size of the /dev/shm inside the container, which is used for interprocess communication for `DataLoader`s. By default it was only 50m, which causes hang ups when used for real-world example like in the tutorials, with 32 workers. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/

                happy to do it, however I noticed a lot less failed image build after adding that. I wonder if the fact that we send 20 requests at the same time for the same package might be a problem.

                that is the timeout for the execution of a single notebook. Good point, I am not sure whether that would fail the test or just move on.

Parallelization with nose test is much simpler than I thought from what we discussed last time, just add:
`--processes=8 --process-timeout=1800 (--process-restartworker)`
It does work with these tests, reducing the time necessary to run them by 60% with 8 workers. However, I would hold back on that because I am not sure how mature this nosetest plugin is. I think the fact these tests spawn an extra process confuses nosetest and I have witnessed some nostests workers crashing that leave python processes orphans, using up GPU memory, and on top of that that particular test case was considered successful.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> nosetest is trying to be smart but in this case since we are spawning a new process we get a whole load of unwanted extra logging:
- the raw text of the notebook
- the debug print out of jupyter (e.g the heartbeat signals of the kernels)
I am already printing the errors and warning (which are captured even with --nologcapture)

I use nosetest-3.4 to run the test as it supports unicode by default, however `MXNET_TUTORIAL_TEST_KERNEL=python2` is what controls the environment the notebooks are being run

                That's the tests we are ok for them not being downloadable as jupyter notebooks, typically C++, Scala, R tutorials

                That is a weird one, might leave out for this iteration and investigate more next week. It runs fine outside the container and in the notebook but hangs indefinitely when run through nosetest in a container using up all CPUs
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I actually found the root cause, the tutorial was running on CPU and using a slow CPU version of MXNet resulting in 32x slow down compared to the mkl version. fixed it.

                added documentation and moved the timeout to 7 minutes, it does indeed fail the test 👍

                I've never seen build failures because of too many request.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Agree, we definitely shouldn't rush parallelization and just take some time to investigate the impact. Thanks for elaborating!
