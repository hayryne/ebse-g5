                This looks good anyway +1

              </div></li><li><div>
                New data format API is cool contribution. thanks. One last thing may be asking you to squash your commits?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm a bit concerned about the license first line:

                I was looking at the copyright

Copyright 1999-2016 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

I guess it's not a problem, but maybe @davsclaus can answer better than me.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @davsclaus  i fixed it
              </div></li><li><div>
                @davsclaus  does this copyright in ref library matter? thx.

@onders86  how to squash commits? can you give me some tips, thx.
              </div></li><li><div>
                No the (c) is not a problem, its fine. There are many ASL2 projects that are licensed by a company, for example Hazelcast is also ASL2 license but (c) from that company
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast-client/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/ClientExtension.java#L2
              </div></li><li><div>
                Its okay about squashing, sadly we don't have a nice way of doing this from the github website, which you can do in some projects. We can merge this as-is.
As if you have not do any squash before it can be a bit danger to do, if you don't do it correct. I have a alias for my git client so I can squash X commits back. I found it somewhere on the internet
```
squash	 =&gt; !f(){ git reset --soft HEAD~${1} &amp;&amp; git commit --edit -m"$(git log --format=%B --reverse HEAD..HEAD@{1})"; };f
```


@kimmking next contribution, then remember to create a JIRA ticket and refer to the CAMEL-NNN number of the JIRA in the commit messages.

                @davsclaus  thx so much. I have squashed commits now.

And thanks a lot to every nice guy here.

                More NPE safe as below i would say

```
Message message = null;
if (exchange.hasOut()) {
	message = exchange.getOut();
} else {
	message = exchange.getIn();
}
if (message != null) {
	message.setHeader(Exchange.CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json");
	message.setHeader(Exchange.CONTENT_LENGTH,len);
}
```

              </div></li><li><div>
                Just a note that exchange is never null, also that getIn or getOut also is never null (they lazy create a new empty message)
              </div></li><li><div>
                We tend to flip this so != null is last
              </div></li><li><div>
                Please set version as variable inside camel-parent/pom.xml 
              </div></li><li><div>
                fixed it, thx
