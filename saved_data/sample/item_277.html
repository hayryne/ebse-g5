                if we don't define the synonyms inside IndexType class, then I agree with you. If the IndexType is aware of the synonyms, then it's the responsibility of the class itself to provide a translation.

&gt; The mapping between the new `IndexType` enum and the old names is needed only by the converter. I think it's a mistake to put that mapping into `IndexType`, and to make the mapping visible via a method (`valueOfSynonym()`). Putting that method into `IndexType` makes the mapping part of the public API.

                Consider `return PRIMARY_KEY;` Similar for the other values.
              </div></li><li><div>
                `name` is an unfortunate name for this property, given that every enum already has a `name()` method. It's confusing and awkward that `name()` and `getName()` return different values.

Below, we call this `synonym`. Consider changing the field to `synonym` and this method to `getSynonym()`.
