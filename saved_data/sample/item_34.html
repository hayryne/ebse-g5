hbase.ipc.trace.param.size{code}
This configuration key needs some work. It's unnecessarily obtuse to me (I read it and have no idea what it actually controls). Why not something like {{hbase.ipc.trace.max.length}} or {{hbase.ipc.trace.log.max.length}}?
{code:java}
+      String truncatedFlag = (truncatedLength == stringifiedParam.length())
+                                                    ? "" : " &lt;TRUNCATED&gt;";{code}
Parens are unnecessary, please drop. Good catch though.

While I applaud you writing a test, I feel like it might be overkill for what it's testing. What about lifting the truncation logic to its own method and testing it directly without having to spin up an entire HBase instance?

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Yes, hbase.ipc.trace.log.max.length this one make sense.
Good idea, will move the logic to its own method and write a test for that.

It will simplify as well.

                Hi [elserj|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=elserj]

Please review and let me know.

Thanks
Krish.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> [~krish.dey], your attempts to mention me directly aren't quite right. Type the "\@" symbol and then someone's name. A link to my Jira profile doesn't actually trigger a message to me (but I'm already watching this Jira issue, so I see everything you do). That said, please be a little more gentle in the comment deletion. We generally don't like folks doing this – we want a clear history of what was done and removing comments make that harder.
{code:java}
private class RpcServerImplForTesting extends RpcServer{code}
Why the need for a custom implementation when you're already using Mockito? You should be able to do something like this:
{code:java}
RpcServer mockServer = Mockito.mock(RpcServer.class);
Mockito.when(mockServer.truncateTraceLogLength(Mockito.any(String.class))).thenCallRealMethod();{code}
&nbsp;
{code:java}
+  Logger rpcServerLog = Logger.getLogger("org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.RpcServer");{code}
Again, use the RpcServer.class, not a String that is the full class name.

nit: how about your method be named {{truncateTraceLog}} instead of {{truncateTraceLogLength}}?

                Hi  [~elserj],
Thanks for the advice here.
Will follow it.

On your comment.

{code:java}
RpcServer mockServer = Mockito.mock(RpcServer.class);
Mockito.when(mockServer.truncateTraceLogLength(Mockito.any(String.class))).thenCallRealMethod();
{code}

Well I could have done it. But I want to pass the configuration  for example.
conf.setInt("hbase.ipc.trace.log.max.length", 250);

This will test the scenario that the configuration is used correctly for the variable traceLogMaxLength.

Thanks again.
Krish

Just pass your configuration object into your method :)

HBASE-20942 Fix ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException for RpcServer TRACE (elserj: rev a2ea72dabaca836be5572d1e93c68ae050390c97)
* (edit) hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/ipc/RpcServer.java

                Hey! Another issue committed to some branches but still left in unresolved state. This makes it difficult for an RM to compile release notes. It would be great if we can stamp out this practice. Commit everywhere at once, resolve the JIRA. If you can't commit to all branches, commit to where you can and then resolve the current issue, and open new issues for forward or backwards ports as needed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm resolving this so the release notes for 1.4.7 are not incorrect
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~apurtell], this is *not* committed to all branches. I'm still waiting on a reply from Duo to commit it to his branch.
              </div></li><li><div>
                bq. It would be great if we can stamp out this practice

If you want to stamp out this practice, you need to stamp out the "asking for approval" on certain branches. You can't have both.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Commit what you can, close the JIRA. Open new JIRAs for remaining commits. Just what I said above. This is not difficult. We just need to do it. 


              </div></li><li><div>
                What we can't abide is something committed somewhere with the JIRA still open. This is incorrect. The change has been committed (at least somewhere). Then the RM comes along and tries to make a release and JIRA state is wrong. 

I'd be happy to revert all commits prior to rolling the RC that correspond to unresolved JIRAs if you'd prefer.

This strikes me as the exception, not the rule.

bq. I'd be happy to revert all commits prior to rolling the RC that correspond to unresolved JIRAs if you'd prefer.

Without snark, I really don't care. You're the RM, so I assume you will do the right thing, given how you are tracking releases.

bq. Commit what you can, close the JIRA. Open new JIRAs for remaining commits. Just what I said above. This is not difficult. We just need to do it.

For something which will be resolved in a few hours, I see this as creating unnecessary work and convoluting what is already a convoluted "what release has a fix HBASE-XXXXX". That said, I don't have the interest to argue about it either.

You say this, but you well know delays here are arbitrarily long. Maybe in a few hours. This time. Meanwhile I've been spinning trying to make a release for four days. Our time collectively is precious and we interact on JIRA in asynchronous ways. I think we can either keep JIRA state up to date with commit status by following my above suggestion, or not. If not, fine, then JIRA will not be an authoritative source for creating change logs and RMs will have to do something else. I think the latter has worse outcomes from the former, would you not agree? I don't think I am asking for too much here.

I honestly don't know what the right outcome is. I don't like the idea of spinning out X Jira issues just to get a single change committed (the hoops to get something committed everywhere is already pedantic). My plan of action will be to just spin out clones for all branches requiring RM-response going forward. I think this will avoid causing more heartburn for the situation you described.
