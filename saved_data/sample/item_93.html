                Are you familiar with `ArgumentCaptors` in Mokito? I find it to be more readable approach to the argument validation than `doAnswer` approach.

                You will want separate captors for each of these and then assert the values.
```java
ArgumentCaptor&lt;String[]&gt; enabledProtocols = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String[].class);
verify(engine).setEnabledProtocols(enabledProtocols.capture());
assertThat(enabledProtocols.getValue()).containsExactly("someProtocol");

ArgumentCaptor&lt;String[]&gt; enabledCipherSuites = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String[].class);
verify(engine). setEnabledCipherSuites(enabledCipherSuites.capture());
assertThat(enabledCipherSuites.getValue()).containsExactly("someCipher");
```
              </div></li><li><div>
                The captor in this commit does capture both String[] values.  The first capture() returns the String[] with "someProtocol" and the second returns the String[] with "someCipher".  I'll add the content checks.

       Should we verify that it is called with a `String[]` only containing the `"someCipher"`?

Review comment:
       Are you familiar with `ArgumentCaptors` in Mokito? I find it to be more readable approach to the argument validation than `doAnswer` approach.

Review comment:
       You will want separate captors for each of these and then assert the values.
   ```java
   ArgumentCaptor&lt;String[]&gt; enabledProtocols = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String[].class);
   verify(engine).setEnabledProtocols(enabledProtocols.capture());
   assertThat(enabledProtocols.getValue()).containsExactly("someProtocol");

Review comment:
       The captor in this commit does capture both String[] values though.  The first capture() returns the String[] with "someProtocol" and the second returns the String[] with "someCipher".  I'll add the content checks.

   The only failure in CI was RedisTestOpenJDK11. That test runs in CI but the test isn't present on `support/1.12` so it's not a showstopper.

   I'm about to merge this. Since it has sat for almost 8 weeks since the CI run was last completed, I rebased it locally to test the build (that passed.) Will wait for this CI build to complete but I won't wait for all the tests to run again before merging. Just wanted to ensure no sneaky conflicts had arisen and it appears that none have.
