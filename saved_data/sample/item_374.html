With this PR we exclude following transitive dependencies

* log4j and slf4j - Prevents pulling of log4j related jars in invoker distribution
* jline - This is required only for CLI which also pull in junit!. For 3.5.0 version these have been made optional ([ZOOKEEPER-1655][1])

With these exclusion invoker.tar size reduces from 46.4M to 45.7M and also the slf4j warnings are not seen. This would also ensure that logging backend is deterministic and not [dependent on runtime][1]

&gt; The way SLF4J picks a binding is determined by the JVM and for all practical purposes should be considered random. As of version 1.6.6, SLF4J will name the framework/implementation class it is actually bound to.

@dubeejw  This log comes from [akka SLF4JLogging][1] which is probably to confirm that slf4j is setup properly. We can disable this by setting log level for `akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger` to WARN

                I'm trying to understand the implications of this patch. One of the concerns in HADOOP-9342 was the version of jline. Should we bump up the version here? Otherwise it sounds good to make it optional. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for the feedback, Thomas. Could you update the patch to upgrade the jline version number, please? If you haven't done it, please make sure it applies to both trunk and 3.4 branch.

                [~isnogood], Do you think you can update the patch to upgrade the jline version? 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I'm not sure it is a drop in replacement, need to try it. Would prefer to separate this from the leaking dependency though. Even if we manage to bump the version, we should still not export the dependency via the Maven pom.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I'm concerned about this change for 3.4. It's less of a bug fix and more of an improvement imo - a change which could destabilize existing downstream users. It's easy enough to specify an exclude if you don't want.

I'm good for changing this in trunk, but I don't see this for a fix release on a stable branch. (just my opinion though, lmk if you feel strongly otw).

If this is ok lmk and I'll commit to trunk.
              </div></li><li><div>
                If JLine gets upgraded in the 3.x line (ZOOKEEPER-1718), then I would suggest to also make the change to the pom to not export the dependency since downstream would be affected in any case. Commit to trunk would be great in any case.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Great. Let's shoot for trunk then (3.5.0).
              </div></li><li><div>
                Updated the patch for ZOOKEEPER-1718 (upgrade to jline2)
              </div></li><li><div>
                Committed to trunk. Thanks Thomas!

I think leaking the jline dependency is not desirable because it is only
needed to run the ZK command line tools while most projects would only use
the client API. For example, jline made its way into the
Hadoopdistribution until it was excluded explicitly.

As for upgrading jlline, that's a good idea as it would make features such
as reverse history search available in the ZK CLI.
