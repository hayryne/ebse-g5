                Damm this is fast. Just voted for it a few days ago.

However is this correct from the commit log? (JAXB format?)

+
+    /**
+     * Uses the JAXB data format
+     */
+    public T csv() {
+        return dataFormat(new CsvDataFormat());
     }

                Patches all applied Claus - thanks for the feedback!
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> trunk now has support for the commons CSV API; though documentation is required

                Sorry for being picky but shouldn't the unit test using assertions instead of Log.debug ;)

In CsvRouteTest it outputs
 log.debug("Received: " + text); 

Wouldn't it be possible to assert that the received string is in CSV format?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> In the 2 CSVDataFormat classes should the OutputStream not be closed in a finally block to do propery house keeping in case of exceptions?
Or am I just being old school?
