   * Returns an immutable Map of Exceptions that occured when initializing

   * during initialization.

   * can be changed as various SolrCore operations are performed:

   *  &lt;li&gt;Failed attempts to re-create a SolrCore using a name already contained in this Map will replace the Exception.&lt;/li&gt;
   *  &lt;li&gt;Failed attempts to reload a SolrCore will cause an Exception to be added to this list -- even though the existing SolrCore with that name will continue to be available.&lt;/li&gt;
   *  &lt;li&gt;Successful attempts to re-created a SolrCore using a name already contained in this Map will remove the Exception.&lt;/li&gt;
   *  &lt;li&gt;Registering an existing SolrCore with a name already contained in this Map (ie: ALIAS or SWAP) will remove the Exception.&lt;/li&gt;

                </div><div><b>description:</b> see parent issue for context.

* CoreContainer should keep a record of failures related to core initialization, keyed off of the core name
* failures should be recorded for both solr.xml initialzation, as well as explicit CREATE/RELOAD requests that fail
* record of failures should be tracked indefinitely until some valid core begins using that name
** ie: actions which register a SolrCore with a name (RELOAD, CREATE, SWAP, ALIAS) should "reset" any existing failures associated with that name
* failures should be available to clients via CoreAdminHandler STATUS actions


                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div><div><b>body:</b> quick patch with all the major functionality and some tests.

lots of nocommits in here, basicly all falling into three categories:

* refactoring - the changes to CoreContainer are all complete and relatively trivial, but involved renaming create/reload to doCreate/doReload which are wrapped in new stub methods that call them in try blocks where the "finally" does all the real work.  This was just for convinience to keep the patch easy to read w/o a lot of re-indenting, and these methods should be refactored away before committing.
* more tests - the key stuff is already covered in the patch, and i did manual testing with CoreAdminHandler, but i definitely want more tests before committing.
* "Directory not closed" - something about this test is causing MockDirWrapper to complain it's never closed -  buti don't think this is a bug in the new code or the test.  I suspect we have an existing bug where SolrCore initialization failures *after* the Directory has already been opened aren't closing the Directory -- so we should get to hte bottom of that (probably in a new issue if i'm correct)
                </div><div><b>label:</b> test
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Updated patch...

* lots of new tests, this covers all the cases i can think of except for what we can't test because of SOLR-3665
* added detailed javadocs for the new public CoreContainer.getCoreInitFailures method 
* the directory not closed problem vanished on it's own -- i suspect SOLR-3656 fixed it.

There are still some nocommits in this patch because of the previously mentioned refactoring (left as is so the patch is readable -- all the refactoring will really do is indent a ton of code inside a try/catch)

I think this is good to go, but i'd appreciate some feedback
