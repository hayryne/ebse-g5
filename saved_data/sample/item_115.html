                </div><div><b>description:</b> We could introduce a RouteBuilderConfigurer interface that would allow to reduce the ceremony needed to set up routes especially when working with CDI/Spring environments like:

{code:java}
@Produce
RouteBuilderConfigurer myRoutes() {
    return builder -&gt; builder.from("").to("")
}
{code}

Would be even shorter in kotlin:

{code:java}
@Produce
fun myRoutes: RouteBuilderConfigurer = builder -&gt; builder.from("").to("")
{code}

A similar idea is implemented in [RouteBuilder|https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/67139e00133b5d276a6eafeea292385089b233b0/core/camel-core-engine/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/builder/RouteBuilder.java#L100-L107] 

[~davsclaus] does it make sense ?

                Yeah sure

                Did you start work on a prototype?
              </div></li><li><div>
                And can we get it working with endpointdsl also ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I've not yet started working on this, I will have a look after 3.1 is out
              </div></li><li><div>
                Got a rude prototype working. Need to add the discover of the interface from the registry / so we can have that @Produces stuff working too

                There is an example at

                [~lb] I wonder if the name should be LambdaRouteBuilder instead of RouteBuilderConfigurer ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~davsclaus] don't ask me about naming :) 

best would have been to use RoutesBuilder but it's already taken so pick the one you'd like more, I've no strong opinions
