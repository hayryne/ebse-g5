                </div><div><b>description:</b> Our front page should highlight the key features of Camel, which we, for now, include in the functionalities section. I like how "key features" are listed on the [Django Overview Page|https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/] and the [Fedora Server Page|https://getfedora.org/en/server/]. They use big icons, bold headings, and one feature per row to make sure the user grasps the importance of each feature. I especially like the content on the Django page which says "Why Django?" followed by adjectives ("Ridiculously fast", "Incredibly versatile", "Reassuringly secure" etc). This makes it so much more easier and interesting to read.

                [~zregvart] [~delawen] [~Aemie] Some initial thoughts on whether this is a good change to make? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The front page already has some key features: Patterns, Components, Runtimes, Data Formats.
You mean we can boost the "commercial" side of them? Or add more quality like adjectives? What do you have in mind exactly?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for raising this issue [~aashnajena]. I can agree that we can tell better what Camel is and what are the main functionalities/benefits of using Camel. We can do that much bolder and present it much clearer than we do now. From talking to folk I also noticed that it's not 100% clear what "Software integration" is, so we can help in defining that on the frontpage as well.

Another issue is that we only have one single top-level message that we can place on the frontpage, currently "Camel 3.4.0 is here! What's new?", I think we need to have more than one. One idea I had is that we introduce a "featured" flag in blog post front matter, and present last 3-5 "featured" blog posts on the frontpage. One example of this is the [Hugo homepage|https://gohugo.io/] that has this just above the fold.
              </div></li><li><div>
                100% agree that we should feature 3-5 blog posts as a section on the front page. I'll try to come up with some rough mock-ups for this. I'm also curious to know if there's a design team associated with Camel which can help us design some custom images/icons?
              </div></li><li><div>
                We don't have a design team, we can create icons ourselves, or we can call out from the community and see if someone would be willing to design some icons for us – for that we would need to describe the icons so folk have something to work with.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I like the idea of using the recent blogs before functionality and I like the manner in which Hugo presents it. I found a particular video link to design for such -&nbsp;[https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/845019/screenshots/7097183/media/02330ede1c4ca58a960fc3648166806a.mp4]&nbsp;

As we have a box design for the section on the frontpage the design of using box could fit quite well just as in the video.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I preferred the manner in Hugo the way they displayed the recent releases of the blogs. So to fit the theme or website minimalistic layout, I created a design (blog-frontpage-display.png) that is minimal covers the necessary aspect and fits in with the rest of the front page design. Let me know your views on the same.
              </div></li><li><div>
                blog-frontpage-display.png - looks really good [~Aemie], I wonder if you have any ideas on how to incorporate it in the frontpage, we wanted to show that there are feature/project sections below the fold in another issue I wonder if we have the vertical space with both?
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~zregvart]&nbsp;As they are the recent blogs, it's best, in my opinion, if it goes right below the *Get Started* button. Also, for defining *Software Integration*, we could make use of a custom tooltip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I like the design! I'm thinking we can probably make the blog posts snippets horizontally longer instead of vertically longer, so that we take up less vertical space, especially on mobile screens. On the desktop screen, 3 posts in a line seem enough to me. I'm also a bit unhappy (only my personal opinion) with our current front page having too much white - all backgrounds, sections etc are white, so I think we can add a bit of colour. I've attached two mockups, I'm not sure which is preferred. With this design, we can think of putting them in a vertical column at the left/right end of our page as well.    
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Since we're talking of the front page design and accommodating blog posts here, I wanted to suggest a few changes (these are just my thoughts). I've noticed a lot of websites use big images to describe what they do, and I think we can do the same. It would also add some colour to our landing page. I've used a dummy image in frontpage-design 3,4,5 but I think it would be good for us to include something like this. Instead of showing "Camel 2.4.2 is here", we can have "Apache Camel" as the heading and show the featured blog posts in the same frame.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I like the design-4 that suits more. If we want to include an image, we would have to design an image that fits the theme or what Apache is about like a camel or so ( and the image can't be the logo ). Also, could you send the snapshot for the image of frontpage-design-4 at 1024px?&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                I haven't exactly thought of the small screen designs, but the idea would be to have the image above the text. I'll implement it once everyone gives their opinions. 

Yes, we will have to design an image as well. I was thinking of illustrating "software integration" through the image (I tried to pick something related for the mock-up). I found some interesting illustrations like puzzle pieces fitting together or gears fitting together etc to represent integration of software sub-parts. I'd prefer to somehow present the "integration" theme in camel colours. I've attached some images I like as integration-x.png 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I have added a gear-design-integration.png and image-design-1.png which fits the integration with puzzle and gear match and I have used the color themes from the website itself.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> This is progressing really good, I like all the mockups done thus far. I'm somewhat sentimental towards the swoosh, do you think we can incorporate it somehow in the design. I think it's really good idea to add colour to the front page, I think we need to do it in a elegant way, to me the the blue/navy colour appears more elegant than better than the orange one, perhaps that particular shade of orange can be tweaked to be less imposing? I think the orange we landed on from the logo, but I think association with the colour of sand could work. I'm particularly fond of the colourlovers site (if you are not aware of it). Here is a query for [desert|https://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/search?query=desert] and [one palette|https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1138281/confidential] (or a general direction) that might work with the navy blue.

Do you think instead of graphics on the right explaining what Camel is we can embed a video? I think we can ask [~weimeilin] for help with a short (30sec or so) video explaining what Camel is.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                # I agree that the orange is too bright and imposing. What would you prefer between frontpage-design-4 and frontpage-design-5?
 # A video could also be very helpful. Especially in this case, because "integration framework" is not very well understood by the masses. Are we thinking of the video of a person speaking about Camel, or an animated video that explains how Camel works?
 # In case we do think of making an image (we can use it in some of the other sections of front-page like functionalities), what kind of things does Camel integrate? What exactly can we show in the images? I really liked the puzzle idea - where we can have a central piece (signifying camel) and other puzzle pieces that plug into it(like components).
 # [~zregvart] For the swoosh - can we do some waves at the bottom of the header-section? It might give a dessert sort of feel (like layers of sand dunes). I can't find exactly what I'm looking for on the internet, but I'm attaching waves.jpg. If we do something like this in light camel colours at the bottom, it might look good. Something like [this|https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-12424022-abstract-background-animation-moving-wave-silk-energy] but much softer and the top waves can have colours that merge with the white background (Purely a suggestion)
              </div></li><li><div>
                # frontpage-design-4 seems much cleaner and neater than frontpage-design-5.
 # If we are planning to use a video, it is best to use animated. People prefer animated videos rather than a person who explains it as visuals help in better understanding (esp documentation wise). I am not that firm on including a video on it though rather we could include a caption to the image.
 # [~aashnajena], I prefer a gear matching rather than a puzzle. I can create an SVG using specific modules of Apache in functionalities with its logo in the center based on the color palette of the website.
 # If we wanted to include a swoosh animation along with an image ( in the frontpage-design-4), I really would prefer it if the swoosh animation in PR#366 ([https://github.com/apache/camel-website/pull/366]) could be used vertically on the leftmost corner below the navbar.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I have added a timeline-based design (timeline-frontpage-releases.png) for releases. The reason I have done that is with the current frontpage-design-4.png suits really well for the desktop version according to me but for smaller screen width, it will just look clustered. In addition to it, I always prefer timeline-based designs when we are presenting to the users/audience time-based releases&nbsp;of the blogs.
              </div></li><li><div>
                One site I look at for inspiration, especially geared toward landing (front) pages is https://hyperpixel.io/ have a look you might get inspiration that way.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm no expert at creating images but I tried to make some gears in Camel-like colours (camel-gears and camel-desktop-gears). Does this look good? [~zregvart] I want to include some icons representing things that camel integrates. Can you list some items we can use? 
 

              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm also trying to make some icons for the functionalities section in camel colors, but I need opinions. I'm attaching runtimes.svg, components.svg and data-formats.svg. [~zregvart] [~Aemie] [~delawen] Do these look fine? Also, I'm not sure how to depict "patterns", any idea on how we should proceed? I have a free trial of adobe illustrator expiring in 2-3 days, so it'd be great if I can get some opinions before that :)

 [^components.svg]  [^data-formats.svg]  [^runtimes.svg] 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I prefer how the gear-design-integration.png appears as it takes ample space and it's clear if we plan to include the icons of each project within it. For the functionality, I like the components.svg and why does the data-formats.svg contains a lot of separate icons within it? The patterns are based on EIP which is focused on message-oriented middleware for the sub-components ( I think I am correct with that ) so we could include 2 icons connected through a form of connection like the ones in actual website, which I really like as well!
              </div></li><li><div>
                 I have attached frontpage-v2.png, frontpage-functionalities-1.png and frontpage-functionalities-2.png to show how I want the front page to look with a broader colour palette. [~zregvart] [~delawen] what are your views on these three mockups? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for making these mockups they all look really good! I like the v2 version of the front page a bit more, I find that the offsetting text vs image makes the design more dynamic. I like the functionalities icons, I’d try to allude to JSON or binary formats in the data formats section. I suggest that you create a PR with what you have here and we can share the preview with the community to gather more feedback. Awesome work!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Oh, and the runtimes could perhaps include a cloud, server (or a data center), or similar.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Okay, I'll try to make a new image for runtimes. What should the EIP icon look like? Also, between functionalities-1 and functionalities-2 which one is better?

New image for runtimes:

[^runtimes-v2.svg]
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I prefer, and this is just my opinion, first design for functionalities (one with alternating icons on the left and right), feels more dynamic. I do like the abstract icons, and I think it’s difficult to find a good representation for EIPs without being specific. I guess we can try something that resembles a pattern in the literal sense, sorry I don’t have a really good idea here.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                The new runtimes icon looks good to me.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Which 3 blogs do we want to feature on the front page?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I really like the functionalities design however that got me thinking it's not going to fit with the camel project design. So I just came up with a rough idea of using carousels for the project page, I have included both *project-desktop-style.png* and *project-mobile-style.png.* I think it will better fit with the current designs that Aashna is moving forward with.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~Aemie]&nbsp;Sorry I just saw this! I was implementing the front page design and I noticed this as well, so I made some changes to the projects section. I thought that including a bit of orange will make it fit better with the rest of the design. Please have a look at it on [PR #442|https://github.com/apache/camel-website/pull/442] and we can take it forward from there.

   I would like to suggest a couple of changes - 
   * Include a border-bottom &amp; box-shadow in the navbar to show visible segregation between the body of page and navbar.
   * Reduce the height of the main image. It's extremely huge. 
   * I would like to see the releases as soon as I land on the page ( in the case of the wider screen width ).
   * Increase the line spacing between the text below **Apache Camel** on the front page.
   * Increase the font-size for the complete date within releases.

   I've restricted the height of the main image, so now the blogs should also be visible to you on the first frame. Thanks for the "What Is Camel" link, I've added that and increased the line-height. 
   Not sure why we need to increase the font for blog-dates. I also feel that the header menu looks neater and more modern this way (I'm not a big fan of the shadow effect), that's why I had made the change in the first place. Maybe we can introduce a segregation line once the user starts scrolling beyond the header section. More opinions are welcome! :)

   @aashnajena  the reason to increase the font-size of the data is 'cause currently it looks all clustered one after the another. I provided the snapshot and I think if I land on the desktop I observe till the releases only on the first go. And the reason I am telling to not remove the box-shadow is 'cause if you observe in the mobile view, it just doesn't fit the theme it looks confusing and plain. The navbar pattern you're suggestion looks neat on the personal portfolio I am not sure about this site tho.
   
   Also, I observed and have suggestions for the project section. 
   * It would be nicer to have a consistent flow of how each section is structure i.e covered the same amount of horizontal section as the current website layout is. 
   * The width of the complete section could be altered to make the changes as in the snapshot.
   * Apart from that, I find it best fit to not assign a height to the images as they end up looking inconsistent (Camel-K image appears smaller than others) and keep a margin of 1 rem between the image and content.
   * The paragraph could be explicitly assigned a height so that the button to click appears at the same level for each project.

   I've included changes from the community page PR, as well as made a few changes of my own. The reason we need to specify image height is that the Kafka logo is longer than others, so it will appear much bigger if there's no height restriction. I've added more space between the project logo and description as suggested.
   Honestly, I really like how the functionalities section looks because it's compact and narrow. The blog section will also need more horizontal space than other sections. Is it really problematic to have sections of different widths? We can align the "projects" and "open-source" section since the last section is small.

Review comment:
       Perhaps:
   ```suggestion
       flex-direction: column;
   ```
   
   To make the "Apache Camel" above the image, since currently image doesn't really depict what Camel is?

       I'd use `&lt;ol&gt;` and `&lt;li&gt;` for each blog post, this helps screen readers.

Review comment:
       Do you think we could fit more than 3, perhaps by reducing the font size of the date presented? It's quite large and probably not the more important than other text.

       Use semantic HTML here, [`&lt;time&gt;`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) would be appropriate I think.

Review comment:
       &gt; Perhaps:
   &gt; 
   &gt; To make the "Apache Camel" above the image, since currently image doesn't really depict what Camel is?
   
   I completely understand your point, but between 1 &amp; 2, I think 2 looks aesthetically better than 1. What do you think?

Review comment:
       Fitting more than 3 in a row would be difficult near on small screens. We can make use of a carousel to display more blogs. We can display 3 by default and have arrows on both sides, allowing the user to slide and see more blogs. What do you think about this?

   @zregvart I've made most of the changes suggested above. For the featured blogs, I've included all blogs instead of just releases. If the date seems too big in comparison to text, we could move to a layout similar to the Blog page (shown below). We can also convert this to a carousel so that we can include more blogs, plus we wouldn't have to display 3 blogs on mobile view (which takes up vertical space), instead we can just have a carousel that user can swipe through.
