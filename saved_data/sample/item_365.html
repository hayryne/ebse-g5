                </div><div><b>description:</b> I have some reservations about the website footer. On the mobile view, the footer takes up almost the entire height of my device because the Overview, Community and About columns do not fit into one row. Secondly, on the desktop view, the header navigation is fixed at the top, so I can view the header menu while I'm at the footer of the page. Having same links visible on the header menu and footer doesn't make sense to me (Download, Community, Blog etc). I do see a lot of websites having menu links on the footer, but they don't have a fixed navbar.

Suggestions : I looked up best practices for footers. I think we can reduce the number of links we display on the footer, especially the ones overlapping with header menu. We can also add some things (from what I read up on best practices) - form for subscribing to the mailing list, sitemap link, contact information, link to report a bug on the website, privacy policy/ terms of use (if we have) and maybe a subscription for the blog, since we have quite informative and regular blog posts. I also really like the idea of having a row of social media icons in the footer, which a lot of websites do. This will give us the freedom of adding many more icons than on the header menu.&nbsp;

                Really like [Hook Agency website's footer design|https://hookagency.com/]. It's got contact info, logo, subscription form, social media icons etc.&nbsp;The mobile design skips the sitemap and places the logo on top with the rest of the information below it. I also really like the slanting top border for the footer (Not sure if that fits for our site) and the contrast between background colours of the page &amp; footer (this is something we can do with our website). [Sephora's website|https://www.sephora.com/] has topic wise links in the footer but in the mobile view, it's displayed as dropdowns, which looks like a good option to me if we want to keep topic-wise links. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think we can remove some of the links we have, e.g. the ones present on the top menu. We can also collapse the sections (example https://apple.com) as an alternative idea.

The links we need to have as an ASF project are mentioned [here|https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#navigation] and [here|https://www.apache.org/events/README.txt].

We have pages for the [mailing lists|https://camel.apache.org/community/mailing-list/] and for the [chat|https://camel.apache.org/community/irc-room/] (needs update).

We could create a privacy policy based on the [ASF one|https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/privacy.html] (in a separate issue), we don't use Google Analytics so that paragraph is not needed.

                [~aashnajena] [~zregvart]&nbsp;I read through websites regarding the footer design implementation, for the alternate links what I was thinking is to include the ones under documentation 'cause well it takes more time for the user to navigate through it and if they find it in the footer itself, it is easier for them. Other than that, we can include the basic navbar with links to blogs and projects and community pages. Apart from that, I agree to keep social media icons in the footer 'cause the user won't be diverted to another social network from our website when landing itself. If we want to keep icons in the footer, we could just include the GitHub and Jira issue icons.&nbsp;

Also, agree with Zoran to include a privacy policy and sitemap and we could place it right below the copyright note. I like the design of Hook Agency as its spacious and neat however I don't think the site should include the slant in the footer.
              </div></li><li><div>
                By statistics, there are a high number of users that scroll down through footers and it is a good practice to include as much as detailing as possible yet keeping a minimal design. I have added a footer design(footer-design.png) based on what I read and additional features that need to be included. I have tried to keep it as minimalistic as possible. What're your thoughts?

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Few comments:
* the arrow next to the logo makes me think there is a menu behind it
* I think Code of conduct should be under community, or on the bottom with the privacy policy?
* we can put github/twitter/gitter (stackoverflow?) links in the footer as well
* not sure about sitemaps link (what does it lead to?)
* should the mailing list be under "Community"?

                [~zregvart]&nbsp; I took your comments into account and came up with the design (footer-design-2)

Also for the mobile view, I particularly liked the idea of [https://apple.com|https://apple.com/]&nbsp;for making use of the collapsible section. I have added snapshots for it as well.

                [~zregvart]&nbsp;Yes, of course, it was a suggestion as I found it pretty good feature on the apple website.

If you have any further suggestions on the footer, do let me know. I have begun implementing the desktop mode for the footer as of now.&nbsp;[~aashnajena] [~delawen] [~zregvart]
              </div></li><li><div>
                One thing I've noticed is that footers are mostly inverse colored compared to the rest of the website, I was wondering if we could try that. The Apache website also does this. Secondly, I had suggested the addition of a couple of things - form for subscribing to mailing list, which I feel would be very helpful, and links for reporting a bug on the website, contact info etc. Can we include these things? I can make some designs which I had in mind initially, but couldn't implement because I was busy with schoolwork the last couple of weeks.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~aashnajena]&nbsp;about the bug report is through Jira, which can go along with the icons I believe with the footer design I provided, and yes that will be helpful. We could make the list of icons that are required in the footer. I am not sure about subscribing to the mailing list but can be included in the design if required. Apart from that, I began implementation on it, so I hope we are not clashing.&nbsp;

I explored with the inversion look, didn't really suit the design for the website. We could keep a more subtle and light shade bg such as #f5f5f5 for the footer. It seems to be consistent and smooth along with the website design.

Also about subscription to the mailing lists are we taking in the assumption that we will allow the user to collectively subscribe to the whole mailing lists as mailing list consists of 4 sub-lists. Or are we approaching in the manner where we ask to subscribe and provide a paragraph below stating the link to the mailing lists page?
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~zregvart] [~delawen] [~aashnajena]&nbsp;I believe this footer design presented is quite minimal, we can also include the additional info Aashna suggested such as Jira icon for the bug report, and contact info ( not sure about subscription tho ).&nbsp;

I wanted to list out the things on implementation of footer -&nbsp;
 # Implement the footer desktop design for width &gt;= 875px&nbsp;
 # Implement the footer mobile design for width &lt; 875px&nbsp;
 # As the social icons are used in the footer, we don't need it in the navbar anymore. I can do the required changes for it after the two designs are created,
 # Going to create a separate issue to create a page for Privacy Policy Zoran suggested.&nbsp;

So let me know if you do like the design I have attached to the issue so I can be sure to continue on implementation and if any additional things other than the listed are required as of now.

Thanks.

                I think adding a link to the issue tracker makes sense. It is a bit fuzzy, as some sub-projects opted on enabling GitHub issues, so it's primarily used instead of JIRA. I'd try to use the same breakpoints we already have (max-width: 1023px, max-width: 626px, max-width: 480px), if at all possible I would not introduce a new breakpoint. I'm not sure about removing the icons from the navbar, it might end up with mostly empty navbar so we'd have to rethink it. Implementation-wise I'd try to implement this with CSS only and without much animation to keep it as simple as possible.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~zregvart]&nbsp;I still think we could allow a Jira icon as well tho. About removing the navbar icon, I will think about it as removing icons does make it completely plain. I think the changes could be achieved most of it through HTML and CSS itself. Also, about the breaking point, I can bring down the breakpoint to 750px where both designs look good 'cause if I do get down the breakpoint to 626px then for some screen the footer-design would look a bit clustered, I don't personally prefer it being clustered.&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                What is the Sitemap link for? Are we planning on making a site map page similar to Apple? If yes, I'd like to work on it! [~zregvart] [~Aemie] Can you please confirm if that's the idea? I'll make a separate issue on it then
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> [~aashnajena], I really liked their idea of sitemap on the apple site and as ours is heavily documented, sitemap would make it really easy. I dealt with the privacy policy and created a PR for that so it will be great if you can work on a sitemap. However, the one thing we discussed on the call was to generate the whole sitemap. So it will be nice if you can create the issue and then we can have the discussion for it there.

I thought about it, so just sharing the idea here. What we could do is we want the sitemap as one of the Hugo pages. So within the content folder, we could create an automated version of each part like Blog, User Manual, Components, EIP, and so on and then just use the Hugo attributes to list within the HTML file in the layouts folder. The only thing is to create the automated version 'cause it keeps updating and we could fetch it through ./documentation folder in the repo and make use of the title tag of each HTML file (we could use gulp for this).

&nbsp;

[~zregvart]&nbsp;about the breakpoint if I reduce it to 626px so as to include any further new breakpoints, the preview for it is at footer-arrangement-626.png. Are you fine with that? !footer-arrangement-626.png!

   This PR deals with the new design for the footer of the website layout. It covers the following : 
   
   * Use a light soothing background with `#f5f5f5` shade. 
   * Include the required and sufficient navigation links to ease the navigation for the users to different pages. 
   * Create a systematic layout for presentation
   * Privacy policy link to be included after the PR is merged related to it. 
   * Basic Social Icons added to the bottom of the footer. 
   
   An additional feature for mobile footer menu : 
   * An option to toggle so the footer is easy to scroll through and takes in less amount of vertical space.
   
   &gt; This footer is created in account with the best practices for a footer.

Review comment:
       I'd put this breakpoint at 1023px, we do that for the majority of responsive design and if we wish to prevent wrapping About to the second row, it wraps on 667px as well:

       Perhaps we can do a version without JavaScript? Using `&lt;label&gt;` for `&lt;input type=checkbox&gt;` and based on [`:checked` selector](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/c/checked/).

Review comment:
       I think it's debatable if the using `:checked` selector and checkboxes should or should not be used. I think it's fairly common practice that got labeled a hack in the beginning and can't shake this image. For me it's about the simplicity of the solution rather than the technique, and I think in this case we do not need to use JavaScript.
   
   Perhaps more appropriate no-JavaScript solution could be using the [`:target` CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) selector.

Review comment:
       While the `:target` selector works with toggling, it causes unnecessary scrolling in pages. I will try with the use of a `:checked` selector as well but if it works toggling with the checked selector in this scenario, I think in that way we could minimize the use of javascript for navbar burger toggling and the dropdown menu toggling for the mobile version.

   @zregvart  I have made use of checkbox for the toggling effect instead of using javascript for the same now! Also as the toggling works with CSS itself, can we adapt this for the dropdown menu item toggling within the navbar as well and the navbar burger as this will minimize the use of javascript as a whole?

   @AemieJ I think @aashnajena is talking about the vertical padding between two items on the version of the footer for smaller screens. I think that padding can be a bit smaller, the one on @aashnajena version looks okay to me. @aashnajena perhaps you can add a [suggestion](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request#starting-a-review) with the change you made on your end.

   @zregvart I did that still `yarn checks` failed for `integration.html` under **camel-k** and I observed that it is present in the other PR that has been merged and built as well.

Review comment:
       @AemieJ this needs to be:
   ```suggestion
                       &lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="{{siteRootPath}}/community/support/"&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
   ```
   
   Note the `/` at the end of `support/`, without it the URL would point to a file, with it it points to `index.html` in the `support` directory.

                AemieJ opened a new pull request #441:
URL: https://github.com/apache/camel-website/pull/441


   In PR #428, the PR wasn't being built due to an issue within the `footer-content.hbs`. Thus, creating a new PR fixing it as the previous one has been merged and I can't push any further commits to it.

   This is causing [HTML validation issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-15360), I'll try to fix those now.
