pwendell and I discussed this a little more offline and concluded that it would be good to keep it more conservative. Losing cached blocks may be very expensive and we should only allow it if the user knows what he/she is doing.

                LGTM, but in the long term, we can flush cache block to disk and change blocks of executor to blocks of shuffle service. i think more about it and now it has some problem about shuffle service because now shuffle service just receive shuffle request.

                @lianhuiwang Yeah that's not a bad idea. We could also explore some off heap storage solution.
