                @fjy changed as per review comments.

                @fjy made various changes to address all review comments, pls take another look. I have placed links for users to learn details about ingestion spec etc, this doc focuses on data updation only.

                I think Re-indexing should be a completely different section in the ingestion docs with these explicit steps listed out

              </div></li><li><div>
                you mean adding another file batch-delta-ingestion.md and link it in "Ingestion" section in the TOC file ? But that new file will only say what is updated in "docs/content/ingestion/batch-ingestion.md
" in this PR. is that enough or you are looking for something more?

              </div></li><li><div>
                i think we should add batch-delta-ingestion.md and link it from the TOC. The document can be short but we can move the contents around reingestion out of batch-ingestion or repeat the relevant parts

              </div></li><li><div>
                sure, will update soon.

                How do you feel about calling this 'Updating Existing Data'?

                How do you feel about giving this section a title 'Updating Existing Data'?

And then we can explain updates in Druid are done by reindexing or rebuilding segments, and by delta ingestion. We can also mention that lookups provide a way to do updates on a small dimension table.

              </div></li><li><div>
                I think it is useful to say that updates are best done through batch ingestion, and this section will focus on Hadoop based batch ingestion.

                I think examples of a full spec will be really helpful

              </div></li><li><div>
                let's just remove this

              </div></li><li><div>
                why is "delta ingestion" in quotes?

              </div></li><li><div>
                mention the common case of delayed events

              </div></li><li><div>
                Also I think this is a nice place to mention that updates can be an expensive process in Druid depending on what is done
