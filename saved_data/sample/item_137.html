                </div><div><b>description:</b> The delete node code in {{ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager}} is as follows :
{noformat}
       while(zkClient.checkExists().forPath(nodeRemovePath) != null){
          zkClient.delete().guaranteed().forPath(nodeRemovePath);
       }
{noformat}

When instances of a Service using {{ZKDelegationTokenSecretManager}} try deleting a node simutaneously, It is possible that all of them enter into the while loop in which case, all peers will try to delete the node.. Only 1 will succeed and the rest will throw an exception.. which will bring down the node.

The Exception is as follows :

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Patch looks pretty good to me, and I agree that the fix is sufficiently obvious/difficult to test that a test isn't necessary.

My only suggestion is to change the comment to say that the exception "can bring down *the daemon running this SecretManager*" instead of "the node." As it stands, you're using the word "node" twice in the same comment to refer to very different things - one in ZK, one the daemon.

I'll be +1 once this is addressed.

                +1, the latest patch looks good to me. I'm confident the test failure is unrelated, and as mentioned before I don't think this change warrants a new test.

I'm going to commit this momentarily.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks very much for the contribution, Arun.
