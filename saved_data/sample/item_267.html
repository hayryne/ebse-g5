                hi @bhasudha, do you have any suggestions? you can visit https://lamber-ken.github.io/docs/quick-start-guide.html

I checked the updated quick-start-guide, I feel its a bit confusing when we add the python example just below the scala example, instead if we follow a style guide like the [official spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-getting-started.html), having tabs for each language code, it will be easy for the users to follow.

Thoughts?

Hi @vingov  Thanks for the comments. I agree with you and in fact, I was discussing this point with @lamber-ken and I'm investigating how to enable the tab feature. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @vingov does this supercede your work? Or you could add more on top? Trying to understand how’d these two are related.. 

In any case, do you mind reviewing this since you have this working at uber anyway. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @vinothchandar - This is similar to the blog post draft I have prepared, which explains the usage of the hudi reader/writer with pyspark. I will review the example code.

@EdwinGuo - If adding a python code tab is difficult with markdown, let's go with a separate page for explaining the python usage.



              </div></li><li><div>
                @vingov  I had copied the https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/15462e1a8fa8da54ac51f4d21f567f3c288e6701/docs/js/main.js and reference the js lib like: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/spark/46be1e01e977788f00f1f5aa8d64bc5f191bc578/docs/sql-getting-started.md but I got no luck. Maybe re-orgnize the page with spark-shell code snippet on the top of the quick start guide and pyspark on the bottom of the page?  @lamber-ken  what do you think?

First of all, this is a good contribution 👍, it's not a good idea to just copy the `main.js`.
OK, If you have any difficulty doing this, pull this into a separate page is better. :)
              </div></li><li><div>
                @EdwinGuo - Thanks for trying multiple options, I thought it would be easy to create those language-specific tabs, if it too much work, we can create a separate page for pyspark code.

If we were using docusaurus, it would be super easy to create these tab navigation - https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/doc-markdown#language-specific-code-tabs

                </div><div><b>description:</b> *Goal:*
 As a pyspark user, I would like to read/write hudi datasets using pyspark.

There are several components to achieve this goal.
 # Create a hudi-pyspark package that users can import and start reading/writing hudi datasets.
 # Explain how to read/write hudi datasets using pyspark in a blog post/documentation.
 # Add the hudi-pyspark module to the hudi demo docker along with the instructions.
 # Make the package available as part of the [spark packages index|https://spark-packages.org/] and [python package index|https://pypi.org/]

hudi-pyspark packages should implement HUDI data source API for Apache Spark using which HUDI files can be read as DataFrame and write to any Hadoop supported file system.

Usage pattern after we launch this feature should be something like this:

Install the package using:
{code:java}
pip install hudi-pyspark{code}
or

Include hudi-pyspark package in your Spark Applications using:

spark-shell, pyspark, or spark-submit
{code:java}
&gt; $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --packages org.apache.hudi:hudi-pyspark_2.11:0.5.2{code}

                Gave you contributor permissions .. and assigned the ticket to you [~vino]

                Thanks, [~vinoth]!

We don't need to write any wrapper code in python to use it in pyspark, the existing jar files can be packaged and used in pyspark using the data source API method.&nbsp;

To improve the client experience, we need to register the hudi-spark bundle as a package on the&nbsp;[https://spark-packages.org/register]&nbsp;website.&nbsp;[spark-packages.org|https://spark-packages.org/]&nbsp;is an external, community-managed list of third-party libraries, add-ons, and applications that work with Apache Spark.&nbsp;

To register a package,&nbsp;Its content must be hosted by&nbsp;[GitHub|https://github.com/]&nbsp;in a public repo under the owner's account, I guess you can register the package since you are the owner of the repo. Thoughts?

                I think we can skip spark-packages.org for now. the repo is owned by apache not any individual and the register step asks for lot more permissions than needed.. ?

pip should be good enough?

                Status update:
 * -Explain how to read/write hudi datasets using pyspark in a blog post/documentation.- Done
 ** Here is the documentation:&nbsp;[https://hudi.apache.org/docs/quick-start-guide.html#pyspark-example]
 ** There is a separate ticket for blog post -&nbsp;HUDI-825
 * -Add the hudi-pyspark module to the hudi demo docker along with the instructions.- Done
 ** pyspark is now supported in hudi demo docker, here is the [PR|[https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1632]]
 * -Make the package available as part of the&nbsp;[spark packages index|https://spark-packages.org/]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[python package index|https://pypi.org/]-&nbsp;Done
 ** Since hudi is already part of apache project, we can directly use it as a package:
 ** 
{code:java}
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=$(which python3)
spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/pyspark \
  --packages org.apache.hudi:hudi-spark-bundle_2.11:0.5.1-incubating,org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.11:2.4.4 \
  --conf 'spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer'
{code}
