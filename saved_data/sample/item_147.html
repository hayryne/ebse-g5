                </div><div><b>description:</b> Looking at branch-2.1-beta jenkins build, this test case seems flaky.
First, addToInvalidates() is called against a block on a datanode. This removes the dn from the BlockInfo in blocksMap. 

At this point, raising the replication factor can cause the same node to be picked. If the node has already deleted the block, it will work. If not, the replication fails. When it fails, it will take at least the pending replication timeout to reschedule, which is 5 minutes.  But the test will timeout before this and fail. 

We could make it wait for the completion of actual block deletion. Or the test timeout can be made a lot longer, but past jiras against this test case indicate people want this to run faster.
                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div>
                In the log from the build, the deletion happened 3 seconds after setReplication was done. The log shows that triggerHeartbeat() didn't work, because it raced with block report and lost. As a result lastHeartbeat was reset to the block report time and heartbeat wasn't sent right away. The 3 second delay can be explained by this.

It seems that increasing the existing sleep to 3 seconds + slack will prevent this race.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> HDFS-4067 made it better but 1 second sleep isn't enough in some cases.

HDFS-342 was fixed by HDFS-4067 in most cases. In the latest build of 0.23 without HDFS-4067, this test took 641 seconds. After inserting 5 second delay, it finished in 18 seconds.

                The test timeout has been decreased to 1 minute from 5 minutes. If it loses the race, it fails even with 5 minute timeout.

                [~jingzhao], probably you are the best person to review this, since you understand the original issue.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sure, I will review this.

                bq. The log shows that triggerHeartbeat() didn't work, because it raced with block report and lost. As a result lastHeartbeat was reset to the block report time and heartbeat wasn't sent right away. 

I think you're right. When triggerHeartbeat() is called, the main loop of offerService may not be at the stage of waiting for the next heartbeat. In that case the next heartbeat will still need 3 seconds to happen.

+1 for the patch.
