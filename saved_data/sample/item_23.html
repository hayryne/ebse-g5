This jira solves 3 issues with Unsafe operations and ByteBufferUtils
1. We can do sun unsafe based reads and writes iff unsafe package is available and underlying platform is having unaligned-access capability. But we were missing the second check
2. Java NIO is doing a chunk based copy while doing Unsafe copyMemory. The max chunk size is 1 MB. This is done for "A limit is imposed to allow for safepoint polling during a large copy" as mentioned in comments in Bits.java.  We are also going to do same way
3. In ByteBufferUtils, when Unsafe is not available and ByteBuffers are off heap, we were doing byte by byte operation (read/copy). We can avoid this and do better way.

It might be tedious to write such code for every method and its effect might be doubtful, but in the bulk comparison inserting fine reading until reaching an appropriate aligned boundary might be worth. In the Oracle implementation, methods to read/write a single data just use the condition "unaligned", but DirectDirectBuffer.asInt/LongBuffer etc. methods also check the boundary in order to, I think, prepare effective bulk read/write.

Comparison to true/false in {{if}} conditions is confusing. It is appropriate to use the operator "!" instead of comparison to false.

FusszyRowFilter might be appropriate to using polymorphism, making it an abstract class with a static factory method.

All existing code.. Only change is checking whether unaligned rather than Unsafe avail..  So FusszyRowFilter  changes we can do in another IA jira.. You mind doing such cleanup?  If so pls raise a Jira.

The above readst wrong but my guess is that the author was trying to make a point given the odd name of the method.

In unsafeCopy if len &gt; UNSAFE_COPY_THRESHOLD we will call it again to finish up the copy?

[~ikeda] We don't want the range checking because we think we know where we are (famous last words) and it costs. Hopefully we won't be spending too much time debugging corrupt memory reads...

Yes. It will copy in chunks of max 1 MB.. Just as in java NIO package..  

              </div></li><li><div>
                I'm +1 on the patch.

What you think [~ikeda]? Commit this and then file new issues to probe around reads when no aligned facility and/or effects of not doing boundary checks?


              </div></li><li><div>
                There are risks (from the beginning) and if I were I might rewrite whole classes. As for aligned boundary checks I have second thoughts that is overdoing and it is enough to just call the corresponding API for fallback. I rather prefer to respect the decision by VM developers.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Regarding the COPY_THRESHOLD thing that VM does, I could see many other projects that deal with Unsafe also omits that check. Including the alignment but handles the Endian part. Just saying this for info.  So may be other code bases can also see how this can be done. But from me I feel this is ok as the alignment is handled here and if there is no alignment then we fall back to the normal way right?

                bq.There are risks (from the beginning) 
We are adding the missing checks which NIO was doing to make use of the Unsafe. So what else you see?
I think we are better with this and plan to commit tonight IST. Any other improvements, we can raise follow up jiras.

                bq. This part should be rewritten using reflection due to copyright.

What part? Marking unaligned dependent on arch? How would you do that one-liner with reflection? If you search this line on the web, there is at least one instance where this line has a compatible license.... 
              </div></li><li><div>
                The required code is in Bits.java#unaligned()  which is a static private method. Can do reflection call on that.  As it is a private class and private method in Java in future if Java make any changes to Class name or method name or signature, we may land in issues.. That is why I decided to copy paste the code.  
So if there is a consensus to use Reflection based look up, I can change it.
Patch is committed to trunk already. I can do the needful change as addendum commit.
              </div></li><li><div>
                That is a license issue, not a compatibility issue.

The comment
{quote}
+      // Copied from java.nio.Bits.java#unaligned
{quote}
explicit says that, though we could say a quibble that we don't specify which Java implementation we copied the code from :P

Copying from OpenJDK causes GPL pollution, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure about Oracle JDK.

                It looks like below only called on instantiation of UnsafeAccess... 

{code}
   if (theUnsafe != null) {
64	      BYTE_ARRAY_BASE_OFFSET = theUnsafe.arrayBaseOffset(byte[].class);	71	      BYTE_ARRAY_BASE_OFFSET = theUnsafe.arrayBaseOffset(byte[].class);
72	      try {
73	        // Using java.nio.Bits#unaligned() to check for unaligned-access capability
74	        Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = Class.forName("java.nio.Bits");
75	        Method m = clazz.getDeclaredMethod("unaligned");
76	        m.setAccessible(true);
77	        unaligned = (boolean) m.invoke(null);
78	      } catch (Exception e) {
79	        unaligned = false;
80	      }

{code}

i.e. we do the reflection once only?

Patch seems good otherwise.

                Looks like this break compilation in 0.98 now:
{code}

              </div></li><li><div>
                Must have to do with compileSource being 1.6 in 0.98, and 1.7+ everywhere else.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Should we replace 
{source}
unaligned = (boolean) m.invoke(null);
{source}
with
{source}
unaligned = (Boolean) m.invoke(null);
{source}

In 0.98?

              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes only at the load time of UnsafeAccess, we do make unsafe ref (if sun.Unsafe available) and then check for unalign capability.  This is same way as in java nio.

                Sorry for the trouble..  Reopen issue for the 0.98 addendum
              </div></li><li><div>
                As per Lars suggestion.
              </div></li><li><div>
                +1 on addendum. I'm going to commit that to 0.98.
(It works for me compiling with JDK 1.8.)

              </div></li><li><div>
                TestFromClientSide passes. If anything was wrong this, I assume that would fail.
              </div></li><li><div>
                And looks right in the debugger.
