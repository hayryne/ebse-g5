                </div><div><b>description:</b> MAPREDUCE-4311 is changing capacity/max capacity configuration to be floats. We should document that in the capacity scheduler properties docs (http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.23.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html#Configuration).

                The documentation doesn't say the capacities are limited to integers either. Does this warrant a change to the documentation?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I do think it is good if we can be explicit about the supported input format for the config params.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Adding a patch that mentions capacities can be floats. Didn't test as it is tiny change to documentation
              </div></li><li><div>
                No tests include as it is a tiny documentation change.

                can you add it for max capacity also please.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Will add the documentation for max-capacity as well, and upload another patch shortly.
