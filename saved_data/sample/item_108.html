                Since this changes public API, shall we also revert it from master?

                @mengxr Should this be put into master ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                We can keep it in master if the next release is 3.0.

                LGTM. Merged into branch-2.4. @WeichenXu123 Next time please create dedicated JIRAs for each QA task PR. Thanks!

                The next version is very likely to be 2.5.0... 
              </div></li><li><div>
                @WeichenXu123 @cloud-fan I made https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22618 to revert the change in master.
              </div></li><li><div>
                May I ask a question, @mengxr ? The master becomes 3.0 today by @gatorsmile 's PR and I saw the following your comment [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22492#issuecomment-423604739).
&gt; We can keep it in master if the next release is 3.0.

Is there any new reason to change the decision?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @cloud-fan said above the next version is very likely to be 2.5.0 instead of 3.0. Well the next version number is not fully discussed yet. For that reason, I think we should revert the changes in master as well. After that we should check if the feature itself can be added without introducing breaking changes.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thank you! Although `master` becomes [3.0.0](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22606) already and seems to start to target `Mar 2019`, I agree with you on reverting for rechecking, @mengxr . Spark 3.0.0 has better have the minimal number of incompatible APIs.
