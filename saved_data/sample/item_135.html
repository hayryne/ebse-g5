                Looks pretty good to me, Arpit. Thanks for doing this. A few little typo corrections:

# "&lt;td&gt;Formats the namenode. It starts the namenode, formats it and then shut it down.&lt;br/&gt;" - s/shut/shuts/g
# "-nonInterActive: formats the namenode but will fail if directories exist on local filesyste.&lt;br/&gt;" - s/filesyste/filesystem/g
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks for the review Aaron. Made the appropriate changes.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Sorry Arpit, I should have mentioned these earlier. Other changes that I'd like to see:

# I think you have a typo in the "-nonInteractive" option. "Interactive" is one word, and the "a" should not be capitalized.
# It's not obvious from the description of "-nonInteractive" how it's different from regular "-format". We should say explicitly something like "with no options given, prompt the user if there is a pre-existing name dir in the local file system." Likewise, "-nonInteractive" should say explicitly "do not prompt the user, but fail to format if directories already exist."
