                [~jdere] [~pxiong] can you take a look? thanks
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~sershe], thanks for your fast patch and response. So basically, when the file (to be streamed) is empty, your patch will still create the file (the streaming pipeline)? Is there any other way we can improve that so that we do not create the pipeline at all? If I understand correctly, the root cause of the problem is that streaming client is writing data to streaming server but server may wait infinitely when client does not have anything to write (file is empty). Is it possible to use "push" model for the client to push data to the server rather than current "pull" model for the server to pull data from client? Thanks.

                This is writer; this is server pushing data to client. If the server never pushes anything or disconnects, the client just sits around forever waiting for data. At least the close() call should be performed, so that the notification is sent to client and/or the socket is closed. Otherwise the client doesn't know whether server is still doing work, or if it's done. So there's no way to avoid the pipeline.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I had a discussion with [~sershe]. The main draw back of current solution in this patch is that we call "createBucketFiles" and we call "closeWriters" to close it immediately. The reason behind is to keep the client from endless waiting. We explored and discussed different other solutions. As far as we know, it seems that we could not find anything better. I would suggest that we could put some comments about this drawback and some "TODO" comments for future improvement in the code. +1. ccing [~ashutoshc]
