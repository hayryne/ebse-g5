                </div><div><b>description:</b> Currently we generate the configurations manually for Debezium component, this approach is a bit annoying especially if the configuration changes due to new version update which can make it difficult to follow. As suggested by [~jpechane], we can utilize the configurations {{ALL_FIELDS}} property that exists in all DBZ connector configurations and generate concentrate class configurations during compile time using a script through Maven Groovy, Maven plugin or whatever is feasible.
