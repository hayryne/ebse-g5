For each of the components in camel-core, we need to document each @UriParam option. This is done by adding javadoc to the setter method.

    CAMEL-8023 Add javadoc to camel-core endpoints so we have documentation out of the box

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Applied the patch with thanks to Kevin, I also polished some java docs.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> documentation
                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Sorry this is not done yet, this was just the summary of the component.

Each of their options needs to be documented as well. I have made the report generator output which components have missing javadoc, so if you run


cd plataforms/catalog
mvn clean install

There is a list of components with missing javadoc, eg today we have 157

From camel-core that is

[WARNING] 		bean
[WARNING] 		class
[WARNING] 		controlbus
[WARNING] 		dataformat
[WARNING] 		dataset
[WARNING] 		direct-vm
[WARNING] 		file
[WARNING] 		language
[WARNING] 		log
[WARNING] 		mock
[WARNING] 		rest
[WARNING] 		seda
[WARNING] 		stub
[WARNING] 		test
[WARNING] 		timer
[WARNING] 		validator
[WARNING] 		vm
[WARNING] 		xslt
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                PS to see which options is missing, then check the generated .json schema file in the JAR, eg in camel-core, each component has such a file. You can also quickly see them in the target/classes directory.

So for bean component we have
{code}
 "properties": {
    "beanName": { "kind": "path", "type": "string", "javaType": "java.lang.String", "deprecated": "false", "description": "Sets the name of the bean to invoke" },
    "cache": { "kind": "parameter", "type": "boolean", "javaType": "boolean", "deprecated": "false", "defaultValue": "false" },
    "multiParameterArray": { "kind": "parameter", "type": "boolean", "javaType": "boolean", "deprecated": "false", "defaultValue": "false" },
    "method": { "kind": "parameter", "type": "string", "javaType": "java.lang.String", "deprecated": "false", "description": "Sets the name of the method to invoke on the bean" },
    "exchangePattern": { "kind": "parameter", "type": "string", "javaType": "org.apache.camel.ExchangePattern", "enum": [ "InOnly", "RobustInOnly", "InOut", "InOptionalOut", "OutOnly", "RobustOutOnly", "OutIn", "OutOptionalIn" ], "deprecated": "false", "defaultValue": "InOnly", "description": "Sets the default exchange pattern when creating an exchange." },
    "synchronous": { "kind": "parameter", "type": "boolean", "javaType": "boolean", "deprecated": "false", "defaultValue": "false", "description": "Sets whether synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous processing (if supported)." }
  }
{code}

So cache and multiParameterArray have no documentation.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I just added the needed javadoc for the bean component
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/72ec197e3a98d874bcedf3889f398fba2f9c7494/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanEndpoint.java#L98

Similar work for all the other components we have in camel-core, so they are all documented. The documentation can be found on the wiki pages.
