                Thanks Wangda.  Some comments:
The new files are missing apache license headers

The word "Context" in ResourceChangeContext and ResourceIncreaseContext isn't very informative.  Can we instead call them ContainerResourceChange and ContainerResourceIncrease?

(Container?)ResourceIncrease(Context?) sounds like a kind of (Container?)ResourceChange(Context?), when in fact the former wraps the latter with additional information.  This seems a little confusing to me.  Thinking aloud, the design uses ResourceChange for four things: sending an increase request from the AM to the RM, sending an increase allocation from the RM to the AM, sending an increase from the AM to the NM, and sending a decrease from the AM to the NM.  I'm also worried that we might want to later add additional information to an increase request that wouldn't make sense in the other contexts. 

I'm wondering whether we should get rid of ResourceChange entirely and add in a ResourceIncreaseRequest proto?  We would then have:
* AM-&gt;RM increase request: ContainerResourceIncreaseRequest, which includes a ContainerId and a Resource.
* RM-&gt;AM increase allocation: ContainerResourceIncrease, which includes a ContainerId, a Resource, and a Token
* AM-&gt;NM increase: ContainerResourceIncrease, as above.
* AM-&gt;NM decrease: ContainerResourceDecrease, which includes a ContainerId and a Resource.

Thoughts?  Sorry to change things up at this point, but as we won't be able to modify this in the future, I think it's worth putting in the time to get it right on the first try.

{code}
+    Assert.assertTrue(contextRecover.getExistingContainerId().equals(containerId));
{code}
Can use assertEquals here.  This applies to a few other places as well.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Thanks your review,
I agree with your idea, the additional "Context" not bring any more information, and flatten such objects are easier for us to add more information. 
And I think for AM-&gt;NM increase, we don't need ContainerResourceIncrease, just a ContainerToken will be enough. Like what community did in StartContainerRequest, the ContainerId and Resource are already included in ContainerToken. Agree?
I'll change code cause warnings like findbugs and license and upload a new patch later. And please let me know if you've any other ideas :)

Makes sense to me.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks Wangda.  The proto definitions look good to me now.  Just some stylistic comments on the patch:

{code}
+abstract public class ContainerResourceDecrease {
{code}
"public" should come before "abstract".  Also applies to a couple other places.

{code}
+ * Used by AM to ask NM reduce size of a specified container
{code}
Better to spell it out - Used by application masters to as NodeManagers to reduce the size of a specified container.  The same applies to a few different places.

{code}
+      if ((getContainerId() == null) ^ (ctx.getContainerId() == null)) {
{code}
It's more traditional to use "||" which can short-circuit, than "^".  Applies to a couple other places as well.

{code}
+    ContainerResourceIncreaseRequestProto proto = ((ContainerResourceIncreaseRequestPBImpl)context).getProto();
+    ContainerResourceIncreaseRequest contextRecover = new ContainerResourceIncreaseRequestPBImpl(proto);
{code}
Way over 80 characters.
