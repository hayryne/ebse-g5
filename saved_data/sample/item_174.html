                </div><div><b>description:</b> I was trying to configure JDBC fail-over, so I put my mysql driver jar in the KARAF_HOME/lib directory.  I kept getting ClassNotFoundExceptions.  On the advice of someone on IRC, I changed the name to "karaf-mysql-connector-java.jar" and it started working.  Why the karaf- prefix requirement?  If that's the intended behavior, then please update the README file in the lib directory.  It says:

"Any jar in this folder will be part of the main classloader used to load Karaf."

                The lib folder currently only auto adds "karaf*.jar" to the classpath. The work around to this behaviour is to add the jar directly to CLASSPATH in your environment.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> A simple update would be to update the README and online documents to state that the user should add the jar directly to the CLASSPATH environment variable. I'm not sure that changing the current behaviour at this point in the 2.2.x line would be entirely safe.

                I don't like the idea of having to muck with the CLASSPATH environment variable.  Nobody really does that anymore, do they?  Perhaps adding a new folder "third-party" in the lib directory and put that README in there?  That wouldn't change the functionality, really.  It would only break anyone who put a third-party folder in their lib directory manually.
              </div></li><li><div>
                tbh I was always curious about the behavior that we only load karaf-*.jar files from the lib directory. Would make more sense (imho) to load all jar files from this dir. 

From the difficulty it would be

a) change the readme
b) load *.jar instead of karaf-*.jar
c) add a new folder for *.jar

I would rather tend to option (b) but I've no problem with getting over voted :-)

                btw, it might be worth bringing this topic to the dev list; wdyt?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I am attaching the change that allows any jar in the lib directory to be loaded, NOT just the ones that prefix with 'karaf'.
              </div></li><li><div>
                I made the change to both the unix shell and the bat file for windows and tested on both using the postgres driver jar.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Should this be back ported to 2.3?
              </div></li><li><div>
                It was reported against 2.2, so I would hope it would get all the way back to there, unless that's not supported any more.  Thanks, Heath!
              </div></li><li><div>
                back ported the changes to 2.2.12, 2.3.2, 2.4.0.  Tested using the postgresql with the lock configuration on a mac and windows.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Nice work, Heath!  Thanks, man.  
              </div></li><li><div>
                My existing 2.2.x and 2.3.x karaf has a bunch of other jar we put in for other command line purpose.  What is the impact on this enhancement? would this get karaf to confuse due to unknown jars?
              </div></li><li><div>
                @Dan - So are you putting jar files in the lib directory that you do not expect/want to be available to Karaf?  If so then you will have to move them outside of the lib directory.
              </div></li><li><div>
                this enhancement will create surprise to existing user base. 

Also, lib is universal 'lib' directory used by lots of appl and genenated script ( ie produce by appassembler-maven-plugin), each script can place jar file under lib and hand pick the exacts jars to be loaded into the script's main class ( same for karaf ).  This is a good contract which to be broken when next release of karaf that has this enhancement


              </div></li><li><div>
                It will only surprise folks who put jars in the lib directory and counted on them not being picked up because they didn't have the "karaf-" prefix.  The documentation says that *any* jar in that directory should be picked up, so they would have to be taking advantage of this bug in order to be "surprised."
              </div></li><li><div>
                The "lib" directory we're talking about here is the one in KARAF_HOME.  Not some application-specific lib directory.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Yes, i also meant karaf_home/lib directory. I dont think this directory is for karaf only. and also blind-fully load all jars under a popular directory sound dangerous.

May be we should make lib/karaf reserve for karaf?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Hi,

I'm also a little bit concerned about this change.

IMO the jars in KARAF_HOME/lib  which could get loaded by default should be only those that do very fundamental  karaf bootstrap work, any other libs should be installed and  managed as OSGi bundle(including the JDBC driver)

Or for example in KARAF_HOME/lib folder we also have org.apache.servicemix.specs.activator.jar since Karaf 2.3.x(used for endorsed specs), this isn't added in the current Karaf launch script CLASSPATH, we build a URLClassLoader to load it in org.apache.karaf.main.Main.

                Hi, 

Doesn't the jdbc jars have to be loaded for locking before bundles get started?  I didn't think that installing them as bundles would fix the issue described in the ticket, if I remember correctly.

                Hi,

If the jdbc driver is used for failover, as Guillaume suggested, we can add a lib/app/ folder and put the jdbc drivers in, this keep current behavior as is and also can accommodate your scenario, take a look at the discussion here[1] to get more details

                +1 on that, I will revert the lib changes to use karaf* then look at adding the subfolder.  

              </div></li><li><div>
                The failover is a Karaf feature, *not* an "app" feature.  
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ok, this was reverted on 2.2.12, 2.3.2, 2.4, 3.0

I will look into adding a sub-directory for lib/app for putting the jdbc drivers in without having the add the karaf prefix.

                Guys, what do we do with this Jira ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                ping ?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> How about just fix the documentation?  The intended behavior was that only karaf-prefixed jars would be loaded, so the docs are obviously wrong.

                The libraries in {{lib/ext/}} don't need to be prefixed by {{karaf-}}, only those in {{lib/}}.

                Thanks Guillaume, I'm updating the doc.
