From the CI log, the format or code style of some classes are not satisfied.
This can be checked by running "mvn clean install" locally.
                </div><div><b>label:</b> code-design
                </div></div></li><li><div>
                &gt; Please fix CI fail, the reason is for check style

sorry, fixed.
              </div></li><li><div>
                &gt; Should the time style be TIMESTAMP? like @column(nullable = false, columnDefinition = "TIMESTAMP")

Thank you, I will test it.
