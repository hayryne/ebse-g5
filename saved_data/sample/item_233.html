                Fixed in commit 313523d49d11cd32d67a821c9677d891b59b16ed

When user used exit command to exit the CLI, it'll clear the history file.
              </div></li><li><div>
                IMHO, deleting the history file on exit is not a proper solution. We should think of a better way for this issue.
              </div></li><li><div>
                But history file is create again when tenant log. So I think deleting file is not an issue. WDYT ?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Then there is no purpose of having a history file if it is deleted on exit. For me, this solution is not acceptable.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Then we can create separate history file for per user. Then particular your can see his history only. I think that's the best option. Any other Idea ? 
              </div></li><li><div>
                A history file per user is okay for me. It's a better solution than losing the history.
