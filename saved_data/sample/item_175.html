                </div><div><b>description:</b> Currently package:imports by default shows the import filter for imported packages. This is quit verbose though:
(&amp;(osgi.wiring.package=org.osgi.util.tracker)(version&gt;=1.0.0)(!(version&gt;=2.0.0)))

There is an option -p to show only the package. This provides a much better overview but lacks the import ranges.

I propose to parse the filter and extract the package name as well as the  import ranges. Then we can display the import like:
org.apache.aries.util.tracker                 | [1.0.0,2.0.0) 

As this then contains all necessary informations I propose to make it the default view and remove the -p option. We can then have a new option --filter that will switch to the old default view.

                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I am doing some more changes to package:imports and exports:
Both commands will support -p to filter for a package name and -b to filter for a bundle id.

Additionally limit the necessary screen width I plan to replace the optional and resolved columns by one column optional that will show resolved for optional packages that are resolved and unresolved for optional packages that are unresolved.

This is before the change:

karaf@root()&gt; imports 
Package                                       | Version        | Optional | ID | Bundle Name                               | Resolveable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
org.xml.sax.helpers                           |                |          | 48 | org.ops4j.pax.url.wrap                    | true       
sun.reflect                                   |                | optional | 18 | org.apache.aries.proxy.impl               | false 

This is after the change:

Package                                       | Version        | Optional   | ID | Bundle Name                              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
org.xml.sax.ext                               |                | resolved   | 47 | org.objectweb.asm.all                    
org.xml.sax.helpers                           |                |            | 48 | org.ops4j.pax.url.wrap                   
sun.reflect                                   |                | unresolved | 18 | org.apache.aries.proxy.impl   

The result requires quite a bit less screen width and is less verbose.
Packages that are non optional simply output an empty column. 
Please speak up if you do not like the new display style.
