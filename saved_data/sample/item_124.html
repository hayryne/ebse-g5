                </div><div><b>message:</b> [SPARK-29494][SQL] Fix for ArrayOutofBoundsException while converting string to timestamp

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?
* Adding an additional check in `stringToTimestamp` to handle cases where the input has trailing ':'
* Added a test to make sure this works.

### Why are the changes needed?
In a couple of scenarios while converting from String to Timestamp `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` throws an array out of bounds exception if there is trailing  ':'. The behavior of this method requires it to return `None` in case the format of the string is incorrect.

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?
No

### How was this patch tested?
Added a test in the `DateTimeTestUtils` suite to test if my fix works.

Closes #26143 from rahulsmahadev/SPARK-29494.

                Actually, trailing spaces shouldn't cause any errors because `stringToTimestamp` trims its input https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d11cbf2e367317e6a2bedfcd71819ddf485c39c5/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/DateTimeUtils.scala#L221

                Merged to master/2.4
              </div></li><li><div>
                @rahulsmahadev this broke 2.4. I just reverted it from branch-2.4. Could you submit a new PR against branch-2.4? Thanks!
              </div></li><li><div>
                Shoot, thanks for catching that @zsxwing . Looks like some test utility code isn't present in 2.4:

                You described 2 cases in the PR discription `':'` and `' '`. This test checks the first one only. Could you add at least one more check for `' '`.
              </div></li><li><div>
                `stringToTimestamp` returns None becase of invalid time zone `ZZ` at the end. If you replace the string `"2019-10-31T10:59:23ZZ   "` by `"2019-10-31T10:59:23Z   "`, the functions shouldn't return None
              </div></li><li><div>
                You are right this works accurately for trailing spaces, I first enounctered this issue on an older release branch and it did not have the `.trim` . But the fix should work for trailing spaces as well if backported.
