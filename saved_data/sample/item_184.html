                 If a GROUP BY is being done, then the rows are ordered according to the GROUP BY key,
 not by the original row key order of the table (see PHOENIX-3451).
 We check each GROUP BY expression to see if it only references columns that are
 matched by equality constraints, in which case the expression itself would be constant.
 FIXME: this only recognizes row key columns that are held constant, not all columns.
 FIXME: we should optimize out any GROUP BY or ORDER BY expression which is deemed to
 be held constant based on the WHERE clause.
