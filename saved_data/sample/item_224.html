                Is this really a solution to prevent a SOE? I mean, why does this happen?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I agree, but this exception has been reported multiple times, without providing the exact .js code snippet that is causing issue.  The code causing the SOE was added for goto support which IMO is nice to have.

                I think this PR needs a really deep look whether this will not causing other side effects.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks a lot for working on this, Reema!
I think that we should use this solution to just leave a log. Otherwise, it means that we just ignore the bug. I don't think it is good...

I guess that a reporter could not provide an example code because the reporter could not find a file which has a problem. So it is significant to leave the log, I think.

BTW, if the static field is accessed from multiple threads at the same time, it can be an incorrect value? Instead, we should use a method parameter? Am I wrong?

I've verified that SOE does not occur with this change :)

                OF course I can, I'll investigate the JS file and update the issue.

                I was able to isolate the javascript plugin that is causing the exception, unfortunately I could not isolate the exact file, but the problem is in the version of CKEditor that was used in this project, I do not know if with other versions the problem will also occur.

I attached the library in issue

{code}

Let me know, whether you need more info. I hope it is similar to this exception. Smth went wrong with javascript2.
              </div></li><li><div>
                It happens with a PHP project.
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~RodriAndreotti] I cannot reproduce it.

Steps:
 # Create a HTML5/JavaScript project
 # Unzip bibliotecas.zip then copy the directory to the project.
 # There is no exception.

I also copy it to a PHP project but the same result.

Could you provide a reproducible "project" if possible?

My environments:
Product Version: Apache NetBeans IDE Dev (Build 20181016-4daaf04bee3a)
Java: 1.8.0_181; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 25.181-b13
Runtime: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 1.8.0_181-b13
System: Linux version 4.16.0-041600-generic running on amd64; UTF-8;
              </div></li><li><div>
                I found one of the cause:

{code:javascript}
'use strict';

module.exports = function test() {
  var test1 = Foo.test2;
  Foo.test2 = function(err, test3) { return test3; };
  Foo.test2 = test1;
};

{code}
[~rtaneja] Could you have a look at this code? Probably, you should be able to reproduce.
Also see: https://github.com/stefanpenner/get-caller-file/blob/master/index.js
SOE occurred this file.

Thanks.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Maybe, we should add a Logger. Then, count the number of times the method is called recursively(maybe add a parameter to the method?). If the number of recursive call &gt; specific number, leave a log with the file path. That way, we can find the file easily which has problems, I suppose.

                Thanks a lot Junichi for your help. I have added check to exit recursion if it goes beyond a count. Didn't add logger as I'm not sure if having that would be much helpful. For any missing goto functionality, filer can provide sample code.

                This is a blocker for the Apache NetBeans 10 release. Is it a blocker, should it be 'major', what's its status?
              </div></li><li><div>
                I think this is a blocker because there is no workaround... (We cannot edit a JS file has a problem because the exception occurs many times) I suppose Reema is working on this now. The PR has been created.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Well, if the PR is there, that's great news. Have you tried it, does it solve the problem?

                I had a look at it. Perhaps, the exception does not occur but I don't think it is a good way... because just ignore the problem. So someone else should also review it. I've requested the review in the GitHub. https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/994.
