                Looks good, but why did you remove the {{@Override}} keyword?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Because I removed {{findQualifyingTables}} from its super class {{DelegatingScope}} and thus {{findQualifyingTables}} is now a utility method in {{ListScope}} only. {{DelegatingScope#fullyQualify}} now calls {{findQualifyingTableNames}} for both simple qualifiers and compound qualifiers.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Ah great. Could you go further and make {{findQualifyingTables}} final and package-protected?

                Just found out that {{MatchRecognizeScope}} as a sub-class of {{ListScope}} overrides the {{findQualifyingTables}} method. {{findQualifyingTables}} is called by {{ListScope#findQualifyingTableName}} and {{ListScope#findQualifyingTableNames}}. So can I go ahead and change {{MatchRecognizeScope#findQualifyingTables}} to from public to protected?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Could MatchRecognizeScope override findQualifyingTableNames instead?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Think what we could do is to remove {{findQualifyingTables}} from {{ListScope}}, then move the logic into {{findQualifyingTableNames}} and let {{findQualifyingTableName}} call {{findQualifyingTableNames}}, since {{findQualifyingTableName}} is basically to restrict the number of entries returned and is marked as "deprecated" anyway. 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Can I go further to remove {{findQualifyingTableName}} since it is not called anywhere else other than by the same method in sub-classes?
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> No. It's a public method in a public API. We can't remove it until the next major revision. That's why it's marked "Deprecated to be removed before 2.0".

                Could you please take a look at my latest commit on that PR, [~julianhyde]? It simply removed {{findQualifyingTables}} and put the essential logic into {{findQualifyingTableNames}}.

                Fixed in https://git1-us-west.apache.org/repos/asf?p=calcite.git;a=commit;h=55d7c6d.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Resolved in release 1.12.0 (2017-03-24).
