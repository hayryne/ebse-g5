                </div><div><b>message:</b> HIVE-2767 [jira] Optionally use framed transport with metastore
(Travis Crawford via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
Add support for optionally using the thrift framed transport, enabling
integration with environments where that is necessary.

Users may want/need to use thrift's framed transport when communicating with the
Hive MetaStore. This patch adds a new property
hive.metastore.thrift.framed.transport.enabled that enables the framed transport
(defaults to off, aka no change from before the patch). This property must be
set for both clients and the HMS server.

It wasn't immediately clear how to use the framed transport with SASL, so as
written an exception is thrown if you try starting the server with both options.
If SASL and the framed transport will indeed work together I can update the
patch (although I don't have a secured environment to test in).

Test Plan:
Tested locally that client and server can connect, both with and
without the flag. Tests pass.

Just curious, have you seen substantial performance gains because of this. Since, most of the rpc call in MetaStore are of fairly small payload. To me, it appears it won't bring in much perf gains.

While there may be perf gains, this is needed to integrate with our compute grid. Basically a wrapper registers the metastore host:port in zookeeper, and a thrift framed-transport-only proxy proxies metastore requests based on its ZK registration. This lets us launch the metastore on our mesos cluster and still give clients the hard-coded host:port they expect.

  What will happen if the config variable is set to true in client, but is false in server and vice-versa?

INLINE COMMENTS
  common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java:269 This also needs to be added in conf/hive-default.xml.template which serve as a documentation.
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStore.java:3020 In your earlier version of patch you were throwing exception in case both secure mode as well as framed transport is set to true. If you have tested with both true and it works then its fine, otherwise we should throw an exception here.

                travis has commented on the revision "HIVE-2767 [jira] Optionally use framed transport with metastore".

  If just one side of the connection is using the framed transport the connection will fail, likely after the timeout.

  As this is something that is setup just once per site its not likely to change often, and it defaults off, so the risk of casual misconfiguration is low.

  Any suggestions on how to better clue the user in that the transport may be the issue?

INLINE COMMENTS
  common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java:269 Good suggestion, done.
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStore.java:3020 Good suggestion. I don't have an environment to test SASL in, so I'll add the check back.

  Update per comments from review. Add option to hive-default.xml, and disallow framed transport when using SASL as that has not been tested.

              </div></li><li><div>
                @ashutosh - Yeah this test does seem problematic. It works fine in IntelliJ but I can't get it to pass with the command you gave, even when doing a clean trunk build. Looking at Jenkins the test works fine, so perhaps its something to do with my machine (osx 10.7.3).

I'm looking into why the test doesn't work on trunk, then will see if this change affects it.

                @Travis,
It has nothing to do with your patch. Problem exists on trunk. See, HIVE-2937 And ya, its a race condition, so it doesn't show up always.

    HIVE-2767 [jira] Optionally use framed transport with metastore
(Travis Crawford via Ashutosh Chauhan)

Summary:
Add support for optionally using the thrift framed transport, enabling
integration with environments where that is necessary.

Users may want/need to use thrift's framed transport when communicating with the
Hive MetaStore. This patch adds a new property
hive.metastore.thrift.framed.transport.enabled that enables the framed transport
(defaults to off, aka no change from before the patch). This property must be
set for both clients and the HMS server.

It wasn't immediately clear how to use the framed transport with SASL, so as
written an exception is thrown if you try starting the server with both options.
If SASL and the framed transport will indeed work together I can update the
patch (although I don't have a secured environment to test in).

Test Plan:
Tested locally that client and server can connect, both with and
without the flag. Tests pass.
