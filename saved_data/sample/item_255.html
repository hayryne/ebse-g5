                The list of implemented tests:
- tcp client discovery for client only and near cache only modes;
- multiple client nodes altering cache simultaneously;
- server nodes restarts after a client was successfully connected to them;

                Semen, 

On my side Idea shows mess when comparing changes with ignite-sprint-3.

To view the changes done by me the comparison must be done from a common ancestor.
Don't now how to do this in Idea. I use the following command in a terminal:
git diff ignite-sprint-3...ignite-709

Just in case attached a valid patch.
              </div></li><li><div>
                - please add several restarts of client nodes in testCacheConcurrentlyWithMultipleClientNodes
- you need to add all new tests in some test suite (otherwise tests do not run on TeamCity)
- there was wrong copyright in GridCacheTcpClientDiscoveryMultiThreadedTest, fix your IDE settigns
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sergey, now for me tests creating cache from client discovery node hangs: GridCacheClientOnlyTcpClientDiscoveryTest. Probably something could be broken after changes from sprint-3 were merged.

Also please make sure all tests added in ignite-709 pass (IgniteCacheTcpClientDiscoveryTestSuite).

                Semen,
Yes, there was a bug during merge. I've fixed it, GridCacheClientOnlyTcpClientDiscoveryTest pass now. 
GridCacheTcpClientDiscoveryMultiThreadedTest still broken, I'm investigating it.
              </div></li><li><div>
                Please add tests to fully cover cache modes and atomicity modes.

Make sure that suite passes on TC
