We have now much better user-facing documentation.

Only the parts interesting for users of the image are
separated out to the "docs" of Airflow.
The README and IMAGES.rst contains links to those
docs and internal details of the images respectively.

Fixes #10997.

Airflow works best with workflows that are mostly static and slowly changing. When the structure is similar from one run to the next, it allows for clarity around the unit of work and continuity. Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](http://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).

Here just a few examples are presented which should give you general understanding of what you can customize.

This builds the production image in version 3.7 with additional airflow extras from 1.10.10 Pypi package and
additional apt dev and runtime dependencies.

                ```suggestion
In corporate environments, there is often the need to build your Container images using
other than default sources of dependencies. The docker file uses standard sources (such as
Debian apt repositories or PyPI repository. However, in corporate environments, the dependencies
are often only possible to be installed from internal, vetted repositories that are reviewed and
approved by the internal security teams. In those cases, you might need to use those different
sources.
```
              </div></li><li><div>
                ```suggestion
This is rather easy if you extend the image - you simply write your extension commands
using the right sources - either by adding/replacing the sources in apt configuration or
specifying the source repository in pip install command.

It's a bit more involved in the case of customizing the image. We do not have yet (but we are working
on it) a capability of changing the sources via build args. However, since the builds use
Dockerfile that is a source file, you can rather easily simply modify the file manually and
specify different sources to be used by either of the commands.
