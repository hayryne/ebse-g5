Add StorageTool as specified in KIP-631. It can format and describe storage directories.  Fix a bug in `ZkMetaProperties#toString`.

                I know it's correct, but this just looks strange to me. Maybe we could do something like:

```
if size == 1
  print "Found log directory:"
else
  print "Found log directories:"
```
              </div></li><li><div>
                Do we always return zero if we don't throw? What's the use of this return value?
              </div></li><li><div>
                Is this producing JSON? If so, should we use a JSON encoder instead?
              </div></li><li><div>
                It doesn't produce JSON (for example, keys and values are not quoted).

This is intended for human consumption.  It will show up in the command-line output.

                ok
              </div></li><li><div>
                It's mainly for consistency with `infoCommand` which does sometimes return 1.  But I don't feel that strongly about it.

                ok, sounds good
