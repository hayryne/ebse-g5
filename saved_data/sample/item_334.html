During data loading, we will write some temp files (sort temp
files and temp fact data files) in some locations. In currently
implementation, we will add the locations to the CarbonProperties and
associated it with a special key that refers to the data loading.

After data loading, the temp locations are cleared, but the added
property is still remain in the CarbonProperties and never to be cleared.

This will cause the CarbonProperties object growing bigger and bigger
and lead to OOM problems if the thrift-server is a long time running
service. A local test shows that after adding different properties for
11 Billion times, the OOM happens.

In this commit, I clear the property for the locations when we clear the
locations.

This closes #2833

                Is the CI failure related to this PR?
              </div></li><li><div>
                yes. I add another commit to fix this error.
```
For a CarbonWriter, it will clean the temp store at closure. If we clean
it for multiple times, error will occurs, because the corresponding
property key has already been cleaned.

In this commit, we remove the unnecessary clean outside the closure.
