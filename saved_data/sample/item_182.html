                 Do not use URL.equals.  It uses the network to resolve names and compares ip addresses!
 That is a violation of RFC and just plain evil.

 http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#equals(java.lang.Object)
 "Since hosts comparison requires name resolution, this operation is a blocking operation.
 Note: The defined behavior for equals is known to be inconsistent with virtual hosting in HTTP."

 WTF: Why is this done and where is it documented?
 As the java.net.URL Javadoc says, the recommended way to get a URL is via URI.
 http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html
 "Note, the URI class does perform escaping of its component fields in certain circumstances.
 The recommended way to manage the encoding and decoding of URLs is to use URI, and to convert
 between these two classes using toURI() and URI.toURL()."
 A possibly better approach here is to construct a URI and then resolve it against
 a URI for the current working directory.
 But we use this string match for now so everyone can see it doesn't hurt file-only classpaths.

                 Gotta use configscript for this because : separated paths can't have : in them
 and GroovyMain ignores -cp.

                 This works for a URL in the classpath, but there isn't a way to do this from the command line.

                </div><div><b>description:</b> GroovyClassLoader.addClasspath has two kinds of problems with URLs.  

For one thing it uses URL.equals to avoid adding duplicate paths to the classpath.  That is very bad since it is a blocking operation that performs domain name resolution. 

The second thing is that even though it is a URLClassLoader it doesn't add paths that are URIs/URLs as URLs but instead always makes a file: path.

The solution for both is to use URI for making and comparing paths before adding them with addURL(URL).

                While handling URLs in the classpath is not really worthwhile for pre-2.3.0 Groovy, I think eliminating the use of URL.equals should probably be done for earlier versions as a bug fix.

                Patch added to PR #337.  This almost deserves it's own pull, but my codebase and the test code currently rely on the other stuff in #337.

              </div></li><li><div>
                Yeah, looks like it was done then.  I think there are quite a few more issues with URIs in the compiler, but I'm ignoring them for now.
              </div></li><li><div>
                So Jim, was this resolved with PR#337 or is their more work to do? From the description above and the code in the PR, I think we are all good - just double checking with you.
