Set it as a cluster action and update the handler in KafkaApis. We keep the `throttleTimeMs` field
since we intend to enable throttling in the future (especially relevant when we switch to the
built-in quorum mode).

                @mumrah A couple of the test failures indicated that we had to change some code in KafkaApis too. Updated.

                @ijuma, thanks! So, we'll keep the throttle field in the RPC, but we won't actually set the throttle. Seems reasonable üëç

                We have to decide whether we want to do this or remove the throttle time ms from AlterIsr before 2.7.0.
