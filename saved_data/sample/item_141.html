# Where log files are stored.  $HADOOP_HOME/logs by default.
export HADOOP_LOG_DIR=${HADOOP_LOG_DIR}/$USER

Because of this logs are placing under root($user) and this getting called two times while starting process.
hence logs are placing at /root/root/

                Hi Brahma,

You're seeing /root/root from a tarball install?  How did you test this change?

Thanks,
ELi

I have commented (In haddop-env.sh) since LOG_DIR will be set in hadoop-daemon.sh..Like following..

if [ ! -w "$HADOOP_LOG_DIR" ] ; then
  mkdir -p "$HADOOP_LOG_DIR"
  chown $HADOOP_IDENT_STRING $HADOOP_LOG_DIR
fi
              </div></li><li><div>
                Hi Eli,

thanks for look.

Yes.. Logs are placed /root/root/


 
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Thanks Brahma, this is building the tarballs using user root or using the packages?

There are two copies of hadoop-env.sh, let's update both to be consistent.

                I don't like the approach of commenting this line out.  I think a lot of admins will infer from this that uncommenting the line will result in some useful behavior.

A bigger problem is that hadoop-env.sh is sometimes included twice.  For example, hadoop-daemon.sh includes hadoop-config.sh, which includes hadoop-env.sh.  Then later hadoop-daemon.sh includes hadoop-env.sh explicitly.  It seems to me that this is the actual root cause of the issue, and that it is likely going to cause other headaches in the future by people who don't suspect that it will be included twice.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> HI Jay Finger,

Thanks For look..

fyi ..I had proposed following two solutions when I raised..
{quote}
Solution can be removing $user or commenting HADOOP_LOG_DIR in hadoop-env.sh..
{quote}
I am agreeing with you..

It wn't harm by commenting this property since it'll be set in hadoop-daemon.sh...I think it's better to remove $USER..Please let me know..

Anyway this will be addressed by HADOOP-8464.
