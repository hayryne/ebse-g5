                @zjffdu yup I configured it a long time ago and it's working now as well. I'll do a couple of changes and run some tests before notifying you for updates.

                @zjffdu there are a couple of tests that I want to do with the repo for checking out the desired output. Also, have to resolve some of the review comments here then we'll be good to merge this.
              </div></li><li><div>
                @zjffdu hmm seems like the integration tests are failing because I upgraded the guava version to 22.0 from 20.0. They have remove the toStringHelper from Objects and have moved it to MoreObjects starting from version 21.0. I'll go and downgrade the version in the whole project to see if it can run the tests successfully.

                I mean in Zeppelin I could have multiple "names" for the Spark interpreter, it might not be `%spark`
              </div></li><li><div>
                I merged the master branch and renamed the project name https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2649/commits/9fc64c1d2a4a8de136e63c224a8b1c392902e488
              </div></li><li><div>

                would be great to merge this feature so bumping this question :) @ShamsUlAzeem @felixcheung 
              </div></li><li><div>
                Sorry about the delay. Each interpreter can have multiple instances and in more than one groups and/or have more than one names. (see config example [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/fe07e5a4962f9457fc2aca473511a50a553499b0/spark/interpreter/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json#L171) `group` and `name`fields)

One approach is to:
1. get the binded interpreter instead of parsing the text (https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Paragraph.java#L241)

2. from the interpreter instance, get the classname (https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java#L240)

3. check the classname against the well-known built-in ones like `org.apache.zeppelin.spark.PySparkInterpreter` (https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/fe07e5a4962f9457fc2aca473511a50a553499b0/spark/interpreter/src/main/resources/interpreter-setting.json#L171)
