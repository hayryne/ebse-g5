### What is this PR for?
Now travis_check.py script ran by Jenkins in each pullrequest.
In Jenkins output console, outputs are displayed after script return.
This small patch try flush output, so Jenkins output console can display output while script is running.

Also increase check polling up to 2 hours while contributors travis might be busy.

And print link to individual job for convenience.

### What type of PR is it?
Improvement

### Todos
* [x] - flush output
* [x] - increase number of check up to about 2 hours
* [x] - print url link to individual job

### What is the Jira issue?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2123

### Questions:
* Does the licenses files need update? no
* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no
* Does this needs documentation? no

                </div><div><b>description:</b> h3. Motivation

Recently INFRA-13469 reduced simultaneous build capacity of Zeppelin project to 5 from 11.

After that, although https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2003 reduced CI build time by 60%, it's not very difficult to see pullrequests are waiting more than 10 hours in the queue to be tested.

It's mainly because of Apache Zeppelin uses ASF's travis account and the same account serves all project in ASF. It's easy to guess that there will be tons of build requests from various projects in ASF.

By the way, individual contributor fork Apache Zeppelin repository on github to make a pullrequest. And it's not very difficult to setup travis for the fork.

If Apache Zeppelin project can leverage all individual contributors travis account to build the pullrequest, that'll give many advantages.

 - Individual contributor will have 5 simultaneous build slot on travis.
 - No other project shares the travis slot.
 - Individual contributor can control build - cancel, restart


h3. How it works

1. Individual contributor setup travis on Apache Zeppelin fork. (and turn on "Build pushes")
2. Contributor pushes the branch to forked repository
   -&gt; Triggers Travis CI build
3. Contributor creates pullrequest to ApacheZeppelin repository
  -&gt; Triggers Jenkins CI build
4. Jenkins CI build script checks individual contributors Travis CI build status.

Jenkins CI build script will not actually build the project but will just check contributors Travis CI build status. And Jekins CI build script will run on ASF infra (builds.apache.org)

h3. Things to do

Following tasks need to be done.

1. Create build CI script for Jenkins that checks contributor's travis CI
2. Setup Jenkins configuration on builds.apache.org
3. Ask INFRA to turn off pullrequest build on Travis-CI and add Jekins for pullrequest build
4. Add travis setup after fork in how to contribute guide.

                [~felixcheung] i didn't created INFRA ticket yet. Once https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2026 is merged, then i'll create infra ticket to build pullrequest using Jenkins.

AFAIK, INFRA (or other Apache project) does not have something like this.

    [ZEPPELIN-2123] [branch-0.7] backport travis_check.py to branch-0.7

    ### What is this PR for?
    ZEPPELIN-2123 introduces travis_check.py to scale out CI capacity.
    However travis_check.py does not exists in branch-0.7, and PR to branch-0.7 marked as a green without regardless of the actual build result.
    
    Since we're planning to make more releases from branch-0.7 and target branch of some PRs are branch-0.7, i think we need travis_check.py on branch-0.7, too.

    ### How should this be tested?

    * Does the licenses files need update? no
