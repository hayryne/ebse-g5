                </div><div><b>description:</b> When asking for flags like OFFSETS or PAYLOADS with DocsAndPositionsEnum, the behavior was to always return an enum, even if offsets or payloads were not indexed.  They would just not be available from the enum if they were not present.  This behavior was carried over to PostingsEnum, which is good.

However, the new POSITIONS flag has different behavior.  If positions are not available, null is returned, instead of a PostingsEnum that just gives access to freqs.  This behavior is confusing, as it means you have to special case asking for positions (only ask if you know they were indexed) which sort of defeats the purpose of the unified PostingsEnum.

We should make POSITIONS have the same behavior as other flags. The trickiest part will be maintaining backcompat for DocsAndPositionsEnum in 5.x, but I think it can be done.
                </div></div></li></ol></div><div><b>jira_issues_comments:</b> <ol><li><div><div><b>body:</b> I agree, Terms.hasPositions(), Terms.hasFreqs(), Terms.hasPayloads(), Terms.hasOffsets() should be used for these checks up-front.

For the backwards behavior, in 5.x we could use an internal flag to make this work. We still need to improve the flags anyway (e.g. to not overlap, and for the new ones to be a little simpler). This is probably good to do first, I sitll have the issue open for it.

                As ryan mentioned in the email list, this one needs to be in 5.1 or we can never fix it without a tricky semantics-only change.

I will help get this in, ive been hammering tests at it the last few days and I'm satisfied there. We added lots of tests that will get tested across all codecs (including older ones) so we know there aren't sneaky bugs. Basically, this is what we are saving our users from.

Please just give me a few hours for each branch.

                for the backport, I will add a deprecated flag to simulate the null behavior of before. 

This way the Docs/DocsAndPositionsEnum have the old semantics.

TestLegacyPostings tests will move to BasePostingsFormatTestCase and BaseTermVectorsFormatTestCase so all codecs (especially backwards-codecs/) are explicitly tested with both the old Docs/DocsAndPositions and PostingsEnum api.

For a while I thought it was valid and I kept guarding against it and in one case wrote some ugly loop that downgrades bits until non-null.  I don't believe it happened in practice but the docs allowed it so...

[~rjernst] If you don't want to do it or are too busy, I could simply update the javadocs on master &amp; 7x.
CC [~romseygeek] as LUCENE-4524 was highly related and was the commit that actually has the current javadocs about null being permitted.
