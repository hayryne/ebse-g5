                </div><div><b>description:</b> When calling {{within}} method in GeoComplexPolygon you can get errors if the test point of the polygon or the given point is near a pole.

The reason is that one of the planes defined by these points is tangent to the world therefore intersection with the above plane fails. We should prevent navigating those planes ( we should not even construct them).

                [~ivera] I cannot evaluate this today; the patch is too large for that.

The general principle during travel plane construction, however, is to first decide how many dimensions you need to travel in, and then construct the planes then.  It looks like you're changing the dual plane mode to be sometimes single-plane and that seems wrong to me.

              </div></li><li><div>
                No worries, there is no hurry and it should be done with care.

I don't think I am changing the dual plane mode. The only thing I am doing is discarding one plane because it is tangent to the world so I navigate the other two planes.

It seems there are no intersections outside of the world so maybe the problem is in the intersection logic....

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~ivera], in theory that should be fine, but I will need to look at it carefully, so will need to wait until later.
If you include the error you are getting I can maybe tell if it's happening for the reason you think.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> There are two cases in the Patch:

1) Plane outside of the world: The check point is near a pole and one of the travel planes chosen is the plane (almost) tangent to the world. The problem is on method {{computeInsideOutside}} in the {{DualCrossingEdgeIterator }}
{code:java}
// Get the outside-outside intersection point
final GeoPoint[] outsideOutsidePoints = testPointOutsidePlane.findIntersections(planetModel, travelOutsidePlane);  //these don't add anything: , checkPointCutoffPlane, testPointCutoffPlane);
final GeoPoint outsideOutsidePoint = pickProximate(outsideOutsidePoints);{code}
The travelOutsidePlane is actually outside of the world because travelPlane is tangent and it cannot find any intersections. The method pickProximate throws the following error:
{code:java}
if (points.length == 0) {
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("No off-plane intersection points were found; can't compute traversal");
}{code}
&nbsp;

2) Degenerated vector: The test point is in one pole and checkpoint is near the pole but not identical. The {{SectorLinearCrossingEdgeIterator}} tries to build a plane with those two vectors essentially and throws an error as they are almost parallel. In {{FullLinearCrossingEdgeIterator}} ocurrs the same.

&nbsp;

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                [~ivera], the LinearCrossingEdgeIterators are only selected when there needs to be travel in just one plane.  If the travel is so short that no plane can be constructed, then we should have already detected that case because the check point is right on top of the test point, and IIRC we look for that at the very start of the isWithin() method.  If we don't look, we should.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> [~ivera] The "boundary plane is off the world" case is a legit case we need to code for.  I'm not sure how we wind up using the Dual iterator traveling in the wrong dimension for that case though, since by definition the test point or check point is *on* the pole, and therefore the travel in that dimension is distance zero.  We should have selected one of the Linear iterators instead already before we get that far.

I would like to first try and understand why we don't already handle these cases before applying the proposed fix.  If you have details of why the expected things are not happening and how the patch addresses it, I'm happy to go ahead without a careful review.  I've got a tight deadline today but tomorrow should be a little bit easier.

                you are right, all of this might be related to numerical inestabilities.

&nbsp;

case 2) Test point and latitude and longuitude equal to 0. Using the following check points:

a) lat =0, lon=5e-9 : Success (Plane built)

b )lat =0, lon=1e-6 : Error

c) lat =0, lon=1e-12 : Error

d) c) at =0, lon=9e-13 : Success (Numerically identical)

We have a big gap here were vectors are not numerically identical but cannot construct a plane.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                [~ivera] Ok, if there are cases where we should be able to construct a plane but can't, we should create specific plane tests that demonstrate it.  If there are two points that are not numerically identical but we can't construct a plane through them, that's worrying.

I think that's the first step.  If it turns out that's not actually true, that also is useful to know.


              </div></li><li><div>
                It is not a problem on how we construct the planes.

For 1e-5 the plane with fixed Z is chosen and therefore success.

For 1e-6 the plane with fixed X is chosen (because it is first on the if/else statements)&nbsp; and therefore an error.&nbsp;

(The evaluation of the vector for plane X is ~-1e-15 and for plane Z is 0) I guess the fix is to choose the plane with lower evaluation!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
              </div></li><li><div>
                This is worrisome because it seems to me that evaluateIsZero() would return true in both cases.  Numerically there's no distinction between them on that basis.

If you can commit ONLY the tests that fail, annotated with @Ignore, I will start analyzing these as time permits.

The travel in each plane is never less than about 1e-8, so there's no numerical issue with the decision-making logic.  So I agree that we will need to also consider whether the test point or check point is at a pole as part of making the decision as to which route we can take.

                </div></div></li><li><div>
                I take that back.  I see this:

{code}
   [junit4]   1&gt; YIntersectionZ point: travel distance: tpDelta1 = 5.329070518200751E-15; tpDelta2 = -9.999999999999982E-8; cpDelta1 = 0.031087578289355378; cpDelta2 = -0.247403959254523; newDistance = 0.06217515657872048
{code}

That 5e-15 is where the problem is.  Let me try and stop that choice from being considered.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Ok, that choice isn't causing the issue.  

The selection logic winds up picking a path based on deltas that are all not infitesimal.   So we have the following situation: the intersection point is somehow at least 1e-8 from the test or check point, and yet the intersection of the above planes or below planes does not intersect the planet.

So, as you originally proposed, you can check explicitly for the case where the test point or check point is right on the pole.  I don't think, however, that that's a safe check for this condition.  What you want is a check for whether the above plane or below plane intersects the world at all.  Luckily, once the normalized above/below planes are constructed, the check is easy: just look at the D value and compare against the appropriate min/max x/y/z.  If the plane fails the test, then you can't expect to travel in it.

Unfortunately, as a performance optimization, we don't construct the above/below travel planes right now at the time we need them to make this kind of decision -- we wait until we have a crossing to analyze first.  I'll therefore need to restructure things to make that possible.  But that cannot happen today -- it will have to wait.

This is the one where I thought it was not possible to have this situation.  If it really occurs, we should have a test for it, and maybe we need to increase MINIMUM_RESOLUTION.
