                Could you paste the error you're getting with 1.8?

              </div></li><li><div>
                @jeffkaufman Some of the custom paths didn't work in the `server` block, so, I moved to the `http`, but my setting of `pagespeed StaticAssetPrefix "/static/";` is still giving me: `2014/05/19 19:32:54 [emerg] 5484#0: "pagespeed" directive "StaticAssetPrefix" not recognized or too many arguments in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:29`.

              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> @jeffkaufman So, even if I decide not use this feature as it's not been implemented in 1.8, which path should I use in the location - `/pagespeed_static` or the old `/ngx_pagespeed_static`? You understand that there are two issues here, not just one.

                You're right, there's a big problem with `StaticAssetPrefix` in ngx_pagespeed.  The option isn't going to be settable at all until we fix it, which means that the prefix will be `/pagespeed_static/` and can't be configured.

I should be able to get a pull request out to fix this today, and we'll include it in the point release we're putting together.

                @jeffkaufman Thanks.

                This will be in 1.8.32.3
