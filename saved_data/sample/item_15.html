(1) the title 'Using Amazon S3 Storage' is confusing.From my point of view, I think this title means that we can use S3 storage to replace HDFS, I really tried this :(,   always give me errors and hbase even can not start, see error mentioned in jira HBASE-11045.

(2) And the details in this section are more about deploying HBase on Amazon EC2 cluster, which has nothing to do 'using Amazon S3 storage'

(3) In all, I think we need to remove this section, or at least clarify this section if someone fully test HBase on S3.  see HBASE-15646 for more details about this doc.

                It makes sense. Looks like HBASE-15646 over-added the info.  Need to clarify. 
Ping [~mbertozzi], [~misty]
              </div></li><li><div>
                My mistake, due to not understanding S3 properly at the time. Feel free to remove.
              </div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> Provide a patch to remove the 'Using Amazon S3 Storage',  because, this title is confusing and hbase does not fully support Amazon S3, see HBASE-11045. And also 'Storing Snapshots in an Amazon S3' has been covered in section 138.9. no need to have 'using amazon s3 storage' this section in ref guide. [~misty],  are you ok with this patch?

                sounds good to me, the s3 stuff seems to be covered under "Storing Snapshots in an Amazon S3 Bucket" where it makes more sense
