I have not reviewed the patch completely. Here are my early comments:
# Can you add javadoc to the newly added class {{Builder}}
# Instead of deprecating getServer() methods, why not get rid of those methods altogether? You could also leave those methods for now and get rid of them in another jira.
# Typo: method name "setProt" should be "setProto"
# Some of the values while building protocol engine, such as protocol, instance, etc. cannot have default values. It would be good to either add check for that in Builder or ensure it is is checked in {{getProtocolEngine()}} implementation.

Agree it's a typo, but I think it should be "setPort".

bq. Some of the values while building protocol engine, such as protocol, instance, etc. cannot have default values. It would be good to either add check for that in Builder or ensure it is is checked in getProtocolEngine() implementation.

Or perhaps those required fields should be set as part of the Builder constructor, while the other fields are set via the builder set*() methods?

Correct.

bq. Or perhaps those required fields should be set as part of the Builder constructor, while the other fields are set via the builder set*() methods?
Actually I prefer set* methods instead of Builder constructor. That way adding another constructor for another required field is not required.

Thinking more about this, I think the way code is done is probably fine. For required fields, setting to null that results in NullPointerException to indicate programming error is fine. Not sure if there are any other fields which will not cause runtime exception where the default value cannot be valid.

                </div></div></li><li><div><div><b>body:</b> In the patch, I tried to keep the Builder constructor simple(taking only Configuration as input). I think it can give the Builder more flexibility. For example, suppose the constructor takes 3 arguments, conf, protocol and instance. Suppose later on we realized more fields can not be null, we have to either modify the constructor or create a few new constructor, which make it like getServer() again. 

If we want to avoid NullPointerException, we could do a sanity check in the last step build() and throw an exception. The sanity check can be more comprehensive as more needs added later on.

                I see your points, but I'd still prefer to have the truly required fields in the constructor. That way, if we later add another required field, developers' IDEs will pick this up or it will be seen at compile time, instead of waiting for a RTE like NPE or some specific exception we put in the build() method. For what are truly required fields, it seems strictly better to me to catch this at compile time instead of later.

I don't feel super strongly about this. Feel free to roll with whatever you'd prefer.

I agree that bigger constructor has certain merits. However, there are two problems. Firstly, the "truly required fields" are just the truly required for now, and it's hard to predict future. Secondly, even we have a constructor with all the current required fields, the developer can still pass null pointers by mistake. 

Doing param checking and throwing exceptions in last step doesn't seem too strange. Another example doing this is in google library https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/MessageLite.Builder#build%28%29

                bq. Firstly, the "truly required fields" are just the truly required for now, and it's hard to predict future.

Sure, but if/when that future comes, what will have to happen with each of these approaches? In the constructor approach, you'll change the constructor signature and then things won't compile until you've fixed all of the call sites. That is good. In the multi-method builder approach, everything will compile, but you'll have to run all of the tests to find the call sites that you missed when adding a new builder method call, and also will have to hope that the tests in fact do cover all of the call sites. That is bad.

bq. Secondly, even we have a constructor with all the current required fields, the developer can still pass null pointers by mistake.

Of course that's always a possibility, but that seems less likely than a developer forgetting to call a builder method that is in fact required. That's also a possibility with the multi-method builder approach as well - the developer might pass null values by mistake.

But like I said, you can go with whatever you prefer. You haven't convinced me that this is the right way to go, but I'm not going to stop you from doing it.

I am fine with the current approach being taken. If there are issue due to this approach, because of frequent changes in Server, we could always revisit this.

Here are comments for the patch (mostly nits):
# build() method, please follow the coding guidelines and have {} after if.
# Throwing HadoopIllegalArgumentException is fine. But if you are doing that for two of the parameters, I suggest doing the same for handlerCount and conf parameter as well.
# In javadoc for build() method please add @throws and say if mandator fields are not set, the build method will throw HadoopIllegalArgumentException.
# Please add a testcase where you create RPC server without mandatory fields and ensure exceptions are thrown. We could perhaps add this to TestIPC.

Done for conf, handlerCount has a default as "1".

Done.

Done in TestRPC.java.
